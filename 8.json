So, the creator (Me, as I plan on actually doing this), start with a single, vague beginning prompt. Something that can trailhead a story, but is vague enough that many creative branching paths can be invented. The first few visitors will then submit choices for a problem I have submitted. After they think of a choice, they then type in the text what players will see if they make that choice. Before the choice is made public however, the maker of the previous text box (In this example, I), will approve or decline of the choice, and then the cycle continues, with users coming, and branching off of the submitted choices to my prompt, and so on, until we get a seemingly endless quest for any user to play and contribute to! I have much more ideas for this concept, so if anyone's interested, please just comment, I'd be more than happy to talk.",

From the ceiling a large net carrying loads of different kinds of litter (cans, plastic bottles, food waste, paper, wrappers, cardboard, etc... nothing dangerous like glass though) should be hung. Due to the ceiling height, it will hopefully not be noticed by the school children.\n\nSo, the kids go into the hall and then get their standard anti-littering presentation, showing you what it looks like, how gross it is, how it affects the environment and how it attracts vermin. Then, the teacher giving the presentation says \"I hope everyone here never litters again... you don't want this to happen...\" then all the disgusting litter is dropped on the children. Immediately they are covered in filth. After that, several hired actors dressed in scary full-body rat costumes run into the room squeaking madly, terrifying the children. The kids are chased around for a bit until the rats run off.\n\nAfter that the kids are forced to pick up the litter that's been dropped on them. They each get rewarded with some kind of candy treat. Attached to eat treat will be a label reading \"Drop the wrapper and we'll come back\" with a picture of the rats from earlier.\n\nHopefully this could encourage at least some of the kids to not drop litter. Obviously litter bugs will never learn but some improvement is better than no improvement. Also, it shouldn't be done to young kids, just the older children.",

            "selftext": "The 'true' content here is actually a video, but to do justice to the fact that this sub-reddit accepts text posts only, I shall be mentioning the transcript here along with the video link.  \n\n\n**YOUTUBE VIDEO LINK:** [Click Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUvKhgjNMWU&index=9&list=PL_WzuA8QoWBtLdmXheeMKd2sJkzoxEgIJ)  \n \n\n**{Transcript Starts}**\n.  \n\n\nIn life-threatening situations like the one in which ferocious doggies are chasing you or you are about to be slaughtered for cannibalism, stress shifts us into the flight or fight mode which helps us to better handle the situation... but those cases are really rare aren't they?   \n\n\nNormally people are stressed due to very different reasons, perhaps someone broke a promise we made with them, we take stress in that, perhaps students have exams coming up, anxiety takes a toll on them, a loved one passed away, it breaks people, someone publicly insults you, you may take stress in that, you  may have had a fight with a friend, thinking about it may frustrate you... so what is the purpose of these 'general' types of stress that we face in our everyday lives? Why do they exist? what is their purpose?  \n\n\nYou know what! I don't know! but I have got a pretty fascinating idea about it that seems to fit into the puzzle.  \n\n  \n\n\n\nSo let's take a look into that shall we?  \n\n\nIf I were to say so In a nutshell, every and almost all types of stress have the same purpose... whether it be psychological, emotional, spiritual or even physical... they all have fundamentally the same purpose. So what is 'that' purpose?\nIt's very simple actually, the purpose of stress in general is to give you an important message, the moment you figure out and decipher what that message is and act according to that message, your stress vanishes.  \n\n\nSimple as that!  \n\n\nSo what kind of message does stress gives? it may be telling you to do something, to change something in your life... perhaps it's trying to tell you that have to say 'sorry' to the person you hurt, perhaps it's telling you to change your mindset or perspective on something, perhaps it's telling you to quit a job that you don't like to do, perhaps it's telling you to prepare for something, or perhaps it's just telling to stop doing a certain habit and so forth... \n  \n\n\nLet me clear this up with a very simple example of physical stress,  \n\n\nimagine a stickman named bobby, bobby likes to stay healthy and energetic, so he exercises a bit everyday, we astrally sneak up in his room in ghost form and there we see him doing his routinely push-ups.  \n  \n\n\n\nWe can hear him clearly as he loudly counts his pushes,  \n\n\n\nnine thousand nine hundred and ninety seven,  \n\n\nnine thousand nine hundred and ninety eight,  \n\n\nnine thousand nine hundred and ninety nine,  \n\n\n\nand then when he reaches 10,000 push-ups his hands start to tire out and they start stressing a bit...  \n\n\nat this moment his body is giving him a message to stop and rest his hands... if he acts according to this message, his hands will heal soon in a few minutes and his stress would vanish.  \n\n\nbuuuut! if he goes against this message and keeps doing more and more push-ups, his hands are going to break into pain, and because of that excruciating pain he won't be able to properly use his hands for a few days.  \n\n\n\n------\nLet's take another example,\nLet's consider students under exam anxiety, the purpose of anxiety is to prepare an individual for a possibly upcoming event. Students who haven't mentally prepared themselves for failure, or students who only expect to pass... when they suddenly fail, the shock causes them to plunge into depression... some students lose hope in their capabilities and are damaged for life because of this, some even suicide. Recently I heard a news about a student who was studying to be a doctor, when he failed in his exams he burned himself alive.  \n\n\nStudents who think that academic success has nothing to do with one's financial success, they are prepared to and mentally ready fail... they have no issues failing and that's why they don't go through exam anxiety. It's the same with me, when I figured out that my academic success has very little to do with my financial success, I just didn't mind failing in my exams anymore... and that's when I not only completely got rid of my exam anxiety, But I also became the top of the class student.\n  \n\n\nSo over-all exam anxiety is there to help us plan out and mentally prepare ourselves beforehand for failing, so that we don't go through the intenst state of confusion if we were to actually fail.  \n\n\nSo again! anxiety is there to prepare us for future events so that we can have a more proper and calculated life-style.  \n\n\n\n\nSimilarly, different types of stress have different messages to give... if stress is making you focus on something that happened in the past, it may be trying to tell you that there is something important you have to learn from that event.  \n\n\nIf you get stressed while doing something, perhaps stress is telling you that you are not suppose to do that...  \n\n\nIf you get stressed whenever you come to a certain place, then stress could be telling you to change something about it, or perhaps it's telling you to leave that place.  \n\n  \n\n\n\nOver-all, every stress is a message, you have to figure it out what it is and abide by it.  \n\n\nI sincerely hope all of this is making sense... because this a very important concept that you have to realize.  \n\n\n\nThat concludes our discussion about 'why' stress is there, but how can we go about easily realizing what the message of stress is?  \n\n\nSo let's discuss a bit upon that now shall we? Every psychological tool that has been given in this series and as more shall be given, their only purpose is to temporarily relax you, so that you can easily realize what the message is. If you are mentally relaxed then it would be easier for you to consciously think about what the message is and realize it.  \n\n\n\nsecondly, stress itself gives the hint what the message is... if stress is making you focus and question things about a certain event, that event is your hint. If stress comes whenever you think about a person or place or situation, then that is your hint and you need to concern yourself with that.   \n\n\n\n\nSo those are the two points that can help you with easily figuring out the message of stress.  \n\n\nNow the question arises that why should you, I or anyone else go through all of this effort to eliminate stress in the first place? \nAllow me to answer this question like this...  \n\n  \n\n\nSame as 'dakness' is the absence of 'light,  \n\n\nsame as 'evil' can be considered the absence of 'good'.  \n\n\nSimilarly, 'stress' can be considered as the absence of 'relaxation' we can say.  \n\n\n  \n\n\nSo When your deeds, mindset or practices deviate from a path of a 'relaxing life-style', stress comes in the picture to tell you how you can get back!  \n\n\nI hope this makes sense.  \n\n\nIf you wish to have a relaxing life-style devoid of constant stress and misery... you are going to have go through this process of interpreting the message of stress and acting in accord to it.\nbuuuut If you want to live a constantly stressed and depressing life-style, you can skip all of this, no worries.  \n\n\n\n  \n\n\nOn the basis of what we have discussed up until now, I would like to clearify this as well that the more stressful situations you handle and face off, the more capable you will become in handling different types of stressful scenarios, which will allow you to be physically, emotionally and psychologically stronger. And with elimination of 'stress' from your general day to day life, you would now be in a constant state of 'Ataraxia'.  \n\n Congratulations!\n\n  \n\n\nSo let's quickly conclude what we learnt in this video,\n  \n\n\nWe learnt the purpose of stress in general situations with some examples,  \n\n\nwe learnt that the purpose of stress is that it is there to help give us important messages that we can decipher and use to go about living a prosperous lifestyle.  \n\n\n\nWe learnt how to more easily figure out the messages,\nby first relaxing ourselves, and then focusing on the hints that stress left us with.\n  \n\n\nIn the end all I would like to remind you is that stress is an internal guidance system installed into us which is there to help us live an awesome and relaxed lifestyle, so make use of it instead of pushing it away.  \n\n\n\nWith this I think I should wrap up this video,  \n\n\nbe sure to read the description for more information on the topic.

            "selftext": "I've spent the last 24 hours being alternately angry and heartbroken over the shootings in Dallas... I am so damned sick and tired of hearing about mass shootings and the senseless deaths of innocent people. \n\nToday I had an idea which I hope may help, inspired by Dallas PD's use of a bomb disposal robot to neutralize one of the shooters.\n\nSo let me get the bad news out of the way: this idea involves drones. But the good news is that it doesn't need to involve lethal force.\n\nSo you have a \"team\" of four or five drones, all networked together. Three or more drones are automated \"spotter\" drones, equipped with parabolic microphones and/or thermal cameras. When deployed, the spotters are programmed to first triangulate the source of gunfire by determining direction and amplitude of the sound of gunfire from their respective positions, or using thermal signatures in the event that suppressors are employed. I would recommend that the drone control station be able to distinguish police gunfire from shooter gunfire, possibly by linking with microphones installed on squad cars. These spotter drones alone could save lives by rapidly giving police a good indication of a shooter's position.\n\nOnce the position is established, the \"hunter\" drones are activated. These would be human-controlled and ideally carry standard flashbang, tear gas, or pepper spray grenades. A small firearm could be installed to aid in breaking nearby windows to access the shooter's position without giving the shooter line-of-sight to destroy the drone. In cases where non-lethal means are insufficient to dispatch the shooter (time constraints or fortified positions), small arms or fragmentation charges could be installed to quickly neutralize the target.\n\nI know this is potentially furthering police militarization and that makes a lot of people uncomfortable, but this system could be deployed far more quickly than any land-based response and wouldn't risk human lives. The initial cost would be high, but the bulk of the drones would survive each operation and I don't believe there's a price that's too high to save innocent lives. This system wouldn't be appropriate for all situations (the Orlando shooting, for instance) but it could do a lot of good.\n\nThanks for reading, let me know what you all think.",

            "selftext": "So I'm currently in a course to obtain a technical certification for my job, and we each have separate desktop stations where we can work on tasks our instructor assigns. As we work on  the instructor always asks if everyone is done before moving on with a task, but some of us are so deep into our topics and assignments, we don't pay attention. \n\nAs a result, I'd love to make a device that is powered by USB (since we are on our desktop stations and it's an available power source) that will power three LED lights. The lights, red, yellow, and green, will indicate if we are stumped, working, or done, respectively, and feature four modes powered by a button or multiple buttons. The modes would consist of each light being on by itself and then a stop mode (no lights on). I think it'd be a great way to indicate the status of the class without having students feel self-conscious about saying anything. It also lets them speak without having to do so when they are busy.\n\nI know how to solder, but unfortunately know nothing about how to make a board for anything like this and how to power it with a USB. I was wondering if anyone knew anything about how to make this a possibility. Thanks for your consideration!",

I suggest a policy that allows for people to remain anonymous in court cases to protect themselves.\n\nWhenever attorneys speak about their clients they cannot give away clues about them. For instance, in a case regarding a divorce and/or custody of children, this would stop preferential treatment towards women or men in those cases. Anything a client says would have to be made more general. If a case involves a person claiming the other is racist, the attorneys must be able to prove without mentioned the race of the two individuals. If specific words were used that pertain to a race, then only the fact that a racist term was mentioned.\n\nI would love to hear feedback from y'all, whether it is positive or negative, as developing an solution such as this requires a lot of different voices.",

There could probably be some advanced control over what it will remember for any given context to copy/paste association. There might be a list of such associations with a high degree of control, kind of like Gmail's advanced labeling system. Maybe, if we're getting really crazy, you could add rules to each association like \"add 1 to this number for every time it's pasted\" or \"remember this between these two times, but this between these two other times\", etc.\n\nI can think of many ways this would improve my workflow.

And the same for those who get DUI's, officers put a flag on the license about the DUI and to not sell Alchohol for this person and then boom, he/she can no longer get behind the wheel while drunk. Also, if you are caught drunk when you shouldn't be allowed to purchase any form of Alchohol you get mandatory jail time (Like one year+ The time from the other crime you commit)!",

Rather than enable patent trolls or continue to entertain lengthy court battles over who was innovative with phone technology first, why not rebate corporations/patent holders who show their idea was worth stealing? This would incentivize creativity much more than the outside chance of ever collecting royalties through lengthy litigation and extensive bureaucracy. ",

It would be almost like a \"bestof\" type subreddit, with the option to also self-post information or post links to outside sources, and every post would be flaired with the current event it's relating to.\n\n\nFor example: Shit going down in Turkey? Something about a coup? There's a million and one threads about the thing that's happening right now, but why is it happening? What caused it? Who're the major players involved? What does it mean for the rest of the world?\n\n\nOr: Venezuela's economy is on the brink of collapse despite sitting on tons of oil. What the hell happened? Everyone's heard by now that food's hard to come by there, violence and looting are much more common, sanitary products are very hard to find, jobs are disappearing, people are disappearing, etc. But what the fuck caused this? What did the government there do to fuck up this badly? And how does this affect the rest of the world?\n\n\nI think something like that would really give people the chance to get informed about world affairs they're interested in, rather than just jumping into arguments with no more information than \"Well last week I heard the Palestinians shot missiles at Jerusalem! So they're bad!\"\n\n\nedit: I decided to start working on making this, for anyone who's interested. I'll post a link later today.",

            "selftext": "I've been lucid dreaming a ton recently, mostly extremely boring dreams, but yesterday I had one where nearly the entire dream centered around this idea that everyone took their nutrition from these slow drip bags that they hooked into either on their commute to, or at work. They scanned their finger on this machine first thing in the morning that told them their nutritional deficiencies and surpluses, and the machine had these powder containers with isolated forms of each that would then let the corrected amounts of each fall into a solution filled bag below. It sounds fantastical and probably full of holes (certain nutrients not dissolving in the same solution, or chemical reactions between ones that aren't meant to be mixed with others), but I figure I should let people who know what they are talking about break this down way better than I could hope to on my own, rather than just rejecting it based on preconceptions, so I went looking for this specific sub, and now here I am. So how is it looking? Is it even remotely possible? \n\n\nSomething to note that is also somewhat irrelevant to the post, but dealt with the \"tasting and eating food\" problem that is bound to come up. They all had these little tongue things that were like a plastic and reusable, but the gist was that you would put it in this machine that you would type in your favorite foods into, and it would create a chemical code on the platter in the basic shape of the food (probably unnecessary as unless you were craving hamburgers or other foods with distinctive shapes, it would get confusing easily, but I digress) and you would place it over your tongue and be able to taste the food, or at least sense the flavor profiles distinctly enough to single them out. So it didn't feel too foreign, you would \"chew\", or mimic the motion in your mouth, and based on the readjustment of the pad on your tongue, have an ever so slight distinction in taste that \"grew to feel like the real thing\". I swear that part made complete sense when it was explained to me. \n\n\nAnyway, since my dreams are no longer an escape, but now rather a continuation of the boring that happens during the daylight hours, I figured at the very least I should make the effort to share this experience that felt like 6 real life hours to me. At the very least it could be an interesting fantasy world idea for some aspiring writer out there with more motivation on his hands. Either way, I'm interested to see what you guys have to say.",

The artisan can live there and take on apprentices who can also live there. When the business has made enough money the entrepeneur can give ownership of the business to the artisan and start another with a different kind of artisan. This could make it easier for people who have trouble getting a job start an apprenticeship for a trade as well as giving them a place to live if they don't have one. It would make things easier to get into learning a trade and would be a good alternative to college if you didn't want to spend a lot of money on a degree that may or may not help get you a job.

Absolutely no censorship in art allows full expression with absolutely no alterations of real property, only virtual property. Political activists can redecorate the white house or their local city hall, yelp reviewers can leave an open comment on the side of a business wall, artists can repaint their living room or studio as they please, memorials can be dedicated for people who past away in a location, graffiti artists can find a new virtual playing field to leave their mark. Everyone can participate in painting the whole world.

I also want to almost question the readers morals and the morals of humanity through the horrific events while showing that any human placed in conditions so extreme could act the way some soldiers of ww1 did.

The components could be made with rear connectors that create electrical contact with the back panels eliminating the need for copious amounts of individual wires.\n\nAllen Bradley (along with many others) makes the same component with multiple different mounting and wiring configurations. It wouldn't be a stretch for them to make a VFD (or other component) with electrical connections that make contact with the back panel (surface mount). A company could buy a back panel and using an electrical autocad locate all the components and print a prewired back panel that the parts could be mounted on. All the engineering is already done and on schematics. the components are also available in CAD form online. The only additional step would be figuring out how to lay out the paths on the back panel. printing in 3D and some relatively simple software would make it easy.\n\nPros\n\n* Time savings if building multiple panels\n* Eliminate the need for paying for and storing large amounts of wire\n* It would cut back on material waste because the wire would not need to have a jacket and would   always be cut to the exact length\n* The copper would only need to be printed thick enough for the current it was handling. No reason to run 20 gauge wire for a circuit that only requires 1/2 amp\n* more real-estate would be available on the back panel because the wire way and the need for terminal strips would be significantly reduced\n* Completely safe! the circuit paths could be in between two insulating layers with the only contact points being under the controlling devices\n* No more loose wires because their would be no terminals\n\nCons\n\n* Might not be worth the extra engineering time if only one panel is going to be built\n* Upfront cost of the printer\n* Might require another computer program or an upgrade fee\n* Not easy to change if a problem is found (although it could be possible to have expansion in mind by having terminals on the panel just in case)",

The jist of it all is that I might get a job in a city which is about two hours away from home working 12 hour shifts. So instead of renting a condo or room at a pretty high price, I'm considering using my car to sleep in for the ~4 or so nights a week that I'll spend in the city. In terms of laundry and stocking up on food, I can always do that  when I drive back home and do all my preparations.\n\nNow it gets tricky because I need to be able to do this through a pretty large variation in temperatures (Canadian winters galore!) all which remaining relatively low-key since I need to also find a decent place to park up for the nights (or days - the job involves swing shifts).\n\nSo I wanted your inputs, random thoughts, ideas, and everything that comes across your mind about this. If I go through with this, I'll ultimately write up a journal or book about the experience while also filming some clips and putting them up on the web.\n\nI've checked out /r/vandwellers and got a fair bit of ideas. Depending on how my budget allows, I might just convert my existing car (a little ford focus hatchback) or get a fuel efficient van (my dream would be to do this in a Prius or Tesla) and then just go for it as we go along.\n\nWhy - to pay down the revolving debts I have while working my way to escape the \"work so you can afford your payments\" lifestyle my peers are getting caught up in and save up so I can make my money work for me in terms of entrepreneurship and investing.\n\nAnyhow, feel free to tell me why this is a great, terrible, so-so idea according to you and if you've got anything to share :) I want this lightbulb to shine bright - LED level bright ;)",

            "selftext": "Ideally, this app would have a real big catalogue of classic, foreign and independent films. It could have new releases too, but the focus would be movies that can't be seen on theathers. \n\n\nBasically, you would gather your friends on your living room, everyone would sign up to the app (with credit card info), then you'd rent the movie and \"schedule\" the session. The people would turn on their phone location service and join the session, and the total price would be split between you and your friends. You could watch the film on your TV or laptop. \n\n\nThat is the basic concept, an app that allows you to share the price of renting a film with your pals, but only if you watch it together. In this case, attendance should be limited (maybe to 8 people). Speculating a bit more, session hosts could even make money with the app. A person that frequently hosts sessions could get some sort of bonus. There could be open sessions, as opposed to private ones. You'd search for \"open sessions nearby\" and attend. There would be a system for reporting and rating hosts, venues and moviegoers. \n\n\nThere are some safety issues involved in the public session concept, regarding evil users and building safety (emergency exits and stuff). But the basic concept, the private session, seems fair enought to me. It'd make online movie renting cheaper, without harming the filmmakers. Users would have a monetary incentive to watch movies with friends and acquaintances. \n\n\nIn a more complex version, the app could even become a \"on demand theater\" company. Certified venues would display movies according to user demand, charging them via app instead of selling regular tickets. \n\n\nI think this would be a nice way to increase revenue for filmmakers around the world. In Brazil, the movies I like aren't available for online rent. For many movies, my only alternative would be to import the DVD, and that'd be ULTRA expensive. I think filmmakers would be better off knowing that their films are being legally watched in many places, and that at least some revenue is being generated.",

Instead of buying units and terrain pieces like Warhammer, you use your Legos.\n\nThey already have the factions. Pirates, Ninjas, Space Fighters, etc. And instead of building custom walls and scenery out of Styrofoam, you can build them out Lego, making whatever type of setting you want. Even distance can be calculated in the number of bumps on the board/playmat.\n\nLego could use this not only to sell additional minifigs, equipment and scenery pieces, but use it as a simple way to engage children with math as they roll dice, calculate HP, etc. Plus all their older enthusiast would have a way to play with Lego with their friends.\n\nEDIT:\n\nI thought about this a little more last night. They could market the stuff as a separate line, (Lego Battleground or Lego Realms or something.) The pieces would look the same of course, but instead of a standard minifig, the battle minifigs would come with a few weapons or armor pieces. Scenery could be markets under the same label, like broken medieval carts or broken down spaceships.\n\nThe game itself would aim for a simplified version of the miniatures war gaming scene. Instead of having dozens of abilities and stats and rolling to hit, plus damage, plus armor saves, etc. It would focus on simplified game play that would be still be engaging for adults while being simple enough for kids. (Not that there aren't kids playing 40k.)\n\n",

For \"90's Kids\" this is a huge piece of nostalgia, as good or bad as it may be. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LbWWx80ZPA\n\nI think there's huge potential in the general concept of the old franchise, but as the Vice President of the company told me today, a re-brand would be beneficial for it to really take off here in the states. \n\nI would love some ideas on how I could get this project started and what it should look like. Realistically I'd like the initial concept to be crowdsourced. Comment. Ask questions. Anything. I'd love suggestions and I'd love to get this thing started. ",

UV flashlight can also use to detect money and so on.\n\nToday, we are going to talk about the function of detecting the lubricating oil of mechanical engines.\n\nTank007 UV flashlight is a convenient and fast detection tool that Shenzhen Grandoor CO. specially develop for the fluorescent leak detection industry. Tank007 UV Detection Flashlights overcome the drawbacks of common UV lights in the market.It can light up at once, without any waiting.It's also easily to detect the tiny leak in a large area of ??high-intensity illumination.\n\nThe Principle of Tank007 UV flashlight leak detection:\n\nUV Flashlight is also called \"Dark light torch\".The Light Source in UV Flashlight emits the invisible ultraviolet light, which can activate the fluorescent agents to fluoresce. Then, we can find the leakage of the equipment. It uses the principle that LUYOR fluorescent dyes will emit brightly yellow and green lights under the UV irradiation flashlight. That's how the UV flashlight are used in various types of systems to detect fluid leakage. When detect, only need to add a certain percentage of fluorescent dyes to the system. Put on the UV protective glasses after the system works for 3-20mins. Then irradiate the outside of the system with Tank007 UV flashlight, the leaks may emit a strong fluorescence. So, we can see the leakage even the smallest one clearly and quickly. Fluorescent leak detection is the only possible method to measure all the air conditioning and the oil , water system leakage preventive and planned maintenance.\n\nThe applications of TANK007 UV flashlight in leak detection industry:\n\nTank007 UV flashlight can apply in aviation, vehicles, ships , locomotives , metallurgy, mining , refrigeration and air conditioning , HVAC engineering , petrochemical , engineering, machinery and other industries.Tank007 UV flashlight can also be used for engine lubrication , power steering , transmission pipeline transmission, hydraulic transmission, cooling liquefied gases or storage device and such closed loop or non-loop system fluorescent leak detection. What's more, all the car air conditioners, home and central air conditioners, even other commercial air conditioners can be detected by Tank007 UV flashlight.\n\nUV flashlight produced by Shenzhen Grandoor Electronic Co. are widely used in air conditioning refrigerant leak detection , leak of hydraulic equipment systems , engine sealing system leak detection , industrial pipe seals leak , pharmaceutical clean certification examination and other industries. To further serve more customers, Shenzhen Grandoor Electronic Co.has done lots of market surveys and launched a variety of UV flashlight especially for each customer according to their habits.\n\nuv-l03 TANK007 UV Flashlight for leak detection",

            "selftext": "So let's say the goal of the subreddit is to create a 10000 x 10000 detailed pixelart image.\n\nThe first submission to the subreddit would be a blank image with maybe a small character in it. Other people would download that image, add a little bit of their work to it, for example draw another character, and upload it as a new post. Other people would add to that and so on.\nNow there would of course be collisions because some people would for example be working on the same image at the same time, or some people wouldn't like some recent changes to the image and would like to suggest a better alternative. Solution to this would be inspired by how for example Git or SVN systems work:\n\nEach submission would require to be tagged by unique ID that would consist of the poster's username and a sequential number, for example my first post would be tagged [drummyfish1], the second one [drummyfish2] etc. Furthermore every post would require to specify which post it is directly based on, so people who would add to my image would have to write my post ID in the name of their post.\n\nThis way the work would sometimes split into so called forks. These forks could also be merged - for example if there was a fork that had the left side of the image done and a fork that had the right side of the image done, they could be merged to a complete image. In the end, there could possibly be multiple forks that couldn't be easily merged, and would compete for people's votes.\n\nThe point is using only reddit as a platform for the collaboration, as an experiment and kind of a fun game. This could be used to work on more or less any kind of work, not only image - a text novel, a long musical piece, a 3D model etc.",

            "selftext": "I'd like it if there was an event space which was a large warehouse with several working kitchens and private seating/lounge areas. You and your party could rent an area and cook/hang out, basically an offsite dinner party.  (Also: you wouldn't necessarily need to have a big group, 1 or 2 people could rent a space if they wanted).\n\nThe kitchens would already be well-stocked and you could make anything you want or recipes would be provided that used the ingredients available. \n\nThere would also be the option of having a staff chef come to your section and cook for you, chef's table-style (meaning they take suggestions from you and custom make a tasting menu) while you and your friends relax.\n\nThere would be a communal bar where people could order drinks (or a server could also be made available to take orders from your party). Obviously there would be a huge selection of wine, beer, and cocktails/liquor to suit all tastes/menus.\n\nI know there are probably cooking classes where you can do a version of this (bring a group of people out and cook), but I'm envisioning something a little different. There's a lot of food markets like Eataly or the one Anthony Bourdain is creating, huge halls where people can wander around and grab food or a drink from different stalls. This would have a similar vibe, but you would be allowed to \"make yourself at home\" here (like getting a booth at a club or a lane at a bowling alley or whatever, that spot is reserved for you & your party). It would have lounge/boutique hotel feel, there could even be a space for live music (but more as background music, not a big stage for people to crowd around).\n\nIf this type of place existed, it would be a nice change of pace from standard bars/restaurants. Ideally, it would feel like a bunch of simultaneous parties going on, with some chances for cross-pollination (like he communal bar where everyone would go for drinks). I always like the idea of renting time somewhere and having your own space. Basically, I want to stay in, and this would be like going out while still staying in! Also, there's appeal in getting to cook but not having to shop/clean up. It'd similarly be nice to host a dinner party without having to trash your house.\n\nFrom a business perspective, not sure if something like this is really feasible (in terms of operating costs VS potential revenue). Maybe you could do a membership model and have people pay dues and allow them to bring guests.\n",

I imagine it would be eye-opening. And yes, I'd like the cost of incarceration broken out, please, and perhaps also the specific cost of incarcerating nonviolent low-level drug offenders. ",

            "selftext": "It would work like this:\nWe would start with a base point. From there on, we would connect any YouTubers that have worked with them. They would be connected by certain colored lines:\n\n* Red Lines represent people working in person to work on any real-life project. An example would be Filthy Frank & IDubbbz.\n\n* Blue Lines represent people working over the internet to work on any non-real life work. An example would be Vanoss and everyone he plays games with.\n\n* Yellow Lines represent cameos, such as one person appearing to voice a line in an animation, or a slight interaction within a vlog. In order to show who's video interacts with who, an arrow would be at the end of the line, touching the YouTuber who's video the other was featured in (i.e. if person 1 appeared in person 2's video, person 2 would get the arrow pointed at him.\n\n* Green Lines represent someone producing any sort of work for the other to use in their video. The arrow pointing rules still apply here. An example of this would be a YTP Collab, where people send in short clips of YouTube Poops to use in a greater video where they are featured.\n\n*from here on out things get a bit rarer.*\n\n* Orange lines represent a constant collaborative work between two or more content creators, such as the Game Grumps (the reason why it's orange.) Hovering over the line would show the channel/series that the collaborators are working on. So in the event of the grumps, The channels EgoRaptor, NinjaSexParty, RubberRoss, and any others would all have an orange line (that likely intersects with itself in the middle) to each other.\n\n* Purple represents someone **actively** supporting another channel. This would be akin to TearOfGrace. The word actively in this case means that it is stated in a video, is commonly done in nearly every video, and the supporter leaving unique comments about the person. The \"Animation Squad\" may also apply here. **This one isn't very good, and might as well be removed.**\n\nIf two people have done multiple colored works (i.e. working on one video that applies to a red line, and another that applies to a blue line) Then the line color with the most videos attached to it will be that color. (Two collaborators with 15 red videos, 30 blue videos, and 20 yellow videos would show blue.) The only exception to this rule is if the two have an orange line, which, until the work dissolves and has stopped production, would take prejudice over every other color, regardless of amount.\n\nHovering over a line would show something akin to this:\n\n>*Person 1 > Person 2*\n>\n>**Red Works Collaborated:**\n>\n>**Blue Works Collaborated:**\n>\n>**and so on...**\n\nLines between content creators that have stopped collaborating because of a falling out (Such as Keemstar and... Well, everyone.) will repeat a pattern similar to: -/ /-. Any other reason will have a black bar pattern along with the regular color. Tell me if there are any other ways to fix this.\n\n**Things like Authority and who can edit would be up to the person who was crazy enough to make this happen.**",

            "selftext": "So I was tasked to come up with a marketing idea to increase the sales of sustainable food in a supermarket (just any normal imaginary supermarket) in a high school project.\n\nInspired by Pokemon GO, I came up with an augmented reality (AR) app for the supermarket. \n\n**Here is a list of my proposed features:**\n\n* Users can search for products, and the app provides real-time augmented reality overlays pointing to the results, with separate pop-ups for sustainable choices. If the product is out of stock, the app will just display that. ([Mockup](http://imgur.com/a/DSGP5))\n* Price tags can have augmented reality tags printed (kinda like QR codes), that when detected, will display additional information for each product, such as EXPIRY DATE (that would definitely be bolded), certifications, origin, nutrition information, level of endangerment, etc. ([Mockup](http://imgur.com/a/JvGPl))\n* The app can also suggest sustainable alternatives with similar tastes when detecting tags of unsustainable products. \n* Self checkout can be made easier by scanning these AR tags on every product with the app, with direct integration with Apple Pay or Android Pay.\n* Loyalty or sustainability rewards can be featured to retain customers, such as vouchers after purchasing a certain amount of sustainable food.\n\nI thought it was a pretty cool idea, and based on my experiences grocery shopping, it would certainly save me a lot of time if the shop was really huge and I needed to find something: I could just search it and let the app direct me to it. It would also alert me if say, the milk bottle I was picking up is going to expire soon. Most importantly, it can suggest sustainable options which people may not have known about before (like sustainably farmed fish, meat, or cheaper yet less endangered species with similar tastes and texture), and alert people if the food they are buying is facing endangerment (like certain species of tuna etc).\n\n**However, most people I told the idea to thought it was a crap idea.** They said it was too weird for people to walk while waving their phones around when shopping, as if they were filming the place. They thought simple printed eco-labels were a better idea than my app. Which I totally disagree.\n\nSo what do you guys think of this? (Btw pls don't comment on whether this app can be achieved with current AR technology. I just need an idea to be good, the tech can come later for all I care.)",

This would be mostly for people who have already seen the series previously, but it could also work if you just want someone to follow \"the best episodes\" type of thing. ",

It could be described as \"genetic engineering\" in the game's narrative.\n\nIntegrating it further into the game design: depending how you fold the protein, you level-up different abilities (movement speed, HP, spells etc.)\n\nProtein-folding is only one particular crowdsourcing idea I thought of; but it could potentially expand into things like math equations, economics, engineering etc.\n\nAssuming the game is highly replayable (like DotA and LoL) and at least 10-20 protein folding problems get solved each game; it could work better than existing crowdsourcing, problem-solving platforms. \n\nThe end-goal is to have a kind of crowdsourcing problem-solving processor, run by players every time they play the game.\n\nEdit: This project is fairly ambitious - so if I can make it a bit more robust and garner some support; I'm thinking of starting a community around this idea- and build some momentum for it on platforms like Twitch.\n\nEdit2: I think a subset of gamers are incredibly charitable with their time and money, and open to these kinds of projects that combine doing-good with gaming. Example: Awesome Games Done Quick - which was a particular inspiration for this idea.",

To infect someone you'd probably have to get within a certain radius on of a non-infected player, then your phone would vibrate just like if a pokemon was nearby (at the same time the non-infected person would receive a notification as well).  \n\nAt this time a player can open up the AR camera and scan the crowd for a red blob or blue blob to tell if it's a infected/non-infected player nearby.\n\nThe first person to click on the color blob either freezes or infects the other player. A freeze would prevent you from infecting another player for 5-15 minutes.\n\nFor each infection you receive points/gold/whatever, for non-infected players for each hour you keep the game open in the background you receive a small amount of points, increasing more and more for each consecutive hour. \n\nThe person at the end of the month with the most time game running and not infected gets a point/gold jackpot.\n\nNo idea what shop/transaction thing to implement for people to spend points/gold.\n\nI just figured some people may like this game, I remember playing assassin in high school, tagging people in between periods with dairy queen spoons.",

As a matter of fact, he was the richest person on the planet for a long time. How's that for successful?\n- According to people who worked with him, he's extremely hard working.\n- He's a very likeable person. He's done 3 AMAs on reddit already (/u/thisisbillgates/submitted/). He has dedicated most of his life (after quitting Microsoft) to philanthropy and educating the world. Leaving him with a very positive public image.\n- He seems to truly care about the world, and this would be a perfect opportunity to make an even bigger change than he could before.\n- He's a very intelligent person. He posts really insightful stuff on his [blog](https://www.gatesnotes.com/) about economic development and poverty. I'd say he's pretty much the opposite of Trump and any other politician who paints everything black and white and responds to everything with one-sentence soundbites. Yes, I have to be cynical here and say that he'd need to have some good one-sentence soundbites too if he wants to be popular, but it's nothing he can't do.\n- He's 60. Which is a decade younger than all current candidates!\n\nHonestly I think he could have wiped the floor with the current candidates if he had run this cycle.\n\nI wanted to propose Elon Musk as Vice President, but he's not American so he probably couldn't legally run.",

The company hired me early last year. \n\nRecently I thought of a unique idea which could expand the technologies of the products we produce, through doing personal basic patent searches I was unable to find current patents that involve my idea.\n\nI do not remember all of the documents that I signed over a year ago when I was hired, and I want to know what to look for when I receive copies of these documents to protect myself and idea. If I were to go through with patenting I also would like to know how to go about receiving royalties (if possible) for letting my company use my idea.\n\nAlso, as a current student, is there any involvement with universities in regards to patents?

            "selftext": "The Introduction.) I want to spend my time playing outdoors instead of dealing with the logistics of rules so I spent some money (mandatory taxes) hiring representatives to ensure fair governance. Because when they do it right there is more time and less stress for citizens; However there must be flaws in the system because it's not working well enough in my earnest opinion. I've decided to try remedying the situation by being for some ideals and helping focus  efforts into meaningful change. The talent and passion for saving our day to day world that has blossomed or been refined in those feeling The Bern is overwhelming. Throughout history men like him inevitably die, but ideas grow.\n\nI've been quite the joat mon during my life, from trades, public service, applied sciences, healthcare, community organizing, entertainment, computer tech, entrepreneurship, you name it. My delusions usually center around making the world a better place. And I think after the past year of feeling The Bern I've found a new way to fill my days. However it ends up, it will center around connection, positivity, and empowerment. I'm drawn to enabling people to be more effectively involved in the political process. I've spent the last couple of days mulling it over and this is my tentative set of plans:  \n\n1.) For everyone: Organize a **Database of Government Meetings** so that a person can (without record) put in their address and a list of their authorities will be generated with contact information, a brief overview of the office, a basic bio of the people, and a chronological list of publications, meeting times, and places will be generated. It could be connected to a wiki of differing perspectives of issues (like a more robust interlinked www.feelthebern.org).\n\n2.) To foster beginners involvement:  A **Politics-as-A-Hobby TV Show** akin to home reno, travel, or cooking shows. I'm thinking 22 minute episodes where local hosts around the world will follow an outline and interview politicians, public officials, watchdogs, activists, and people on the street. Left leaning talk comedy just isn't doing enough. Each episode would focus on an issue, some microscopic, some international. It would also show part of the process like requesting some files, a meeting, a rally, or a ceremony. A few info graphics or an animated 'historical look back' wouldn't be a bad idea either. Think short versions of www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mh5LY4Mz15o or www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUaInS6HIGo for example. Obviously it would initially be for an alternative distribution channel with the possibility of being shopped to a distributer with a wider audience but still allow hobbyists to follow the open source outline for online viewing.\n\n3.) To develop an intermediate community: A **Civil Citizen's Civic Census** or 'How everyone can help audit their government.' Think of it as a fantasy football league for politics. It would be channeled through an app and coordinating website and forum. This (fairly raw) idea centers around reminding citizens that their governments are accountable employees who are to follow their mandate and are responsible for the public good by acting in the public's interest; People paid with revenue taxed out of earnings are accountable to the public. This isn't about \"I PAY YOUR TAXES!\", it's about citizens reviewing public records and evaluating if the needed tasks are being done, and if we are receiving fair value for what is paid, and educating the public of avenues of recalibration or celebration. What a great hobby. No, really.\n\nWithout a tight or unified deadline the tone could be casual and friendly. There are lots of citizens watchdog groups and think tanks out there, this is more about encouraging casual engagement. Like how asking for $27 donations both empowered the revolution's war chest but also engaged the people allowing them to take an interest in civics. Senator Sanders is the sagest civics professor our world has had in a long time. Let's capitalize on that through exploring, collecting, connecting, and optimizing.\n\nAccessible, casual, civic involvement can be rewarding and impactful. If directly fighting city hall is too steep a climb we can at least cheer and boo them from our seats in the stadium with our friends. This would be a solid pastime for many isolated men, middle aged women, and idealistic twenty somethings (anyone who mindfully wears a tinfoil hat from time to time really). \n\n4.) An advanced method to combat specific systemic unfairness: **Tactical Roundtable Evaluation and Leveraging Strategy** or 'How to hold public officials accountable so people can be informed by truthful and beneficial information.' This would be an applied segregated think tank for individual nation states.\nDo you pay attention to the work your local representatives do? Do you contact representatives from outside your area to hold them to account for the work they are expected to do for you? Do you know who their appointees are? If you think that's interesting this might be for you. Taxes pay for their work, and your work pays for those taxes. You are working so someone else gets a paycheck; I think it's important to check up on them to see if they are doing a good job for you. Trust is earned. This was spurred when I asked 'What can be done to stop the systemic problem of the media acting in breach of the public trust?'. [I'm also concerned about schools in this area.]\n\nUnsponsored and vouched for information sources are rare and time consuming to identify. It's making connection harder. The critical mass of citizens are under-serviced in this area that is supposed to educate us on identifying and rectifying areas where we are under-served. This suspicion is causing dismissive apathy and disillusioned paranoia (both of which are marginalized) exacerbating the problem. People need tasks done. Commissions, committees, councils, and the like are paid for by your work and are for the public good. It's hard to get anything meaningful done if they can act against public interest without accountability. This mandate is perilous (and time consuming) to ignore. This 'grand suggestion box and refinement forum' is for such ideas. Who is not doing their job, and who is following the public mandate when it comes to government integrity? Why aren't they held accountable? What are your solutions? And the like.\n\n4a.) In America for example a path to accountable representation could start at decent news on tv...  \nThe officials responsible for integral media and how they can change the rules:  \nhttps://transition.fcc.gov/mb/mborg.pdf  \nhttps://www.fcc.gov/about-fcc/rulemaking-process  \nIf the officials are unfair then the provided recourse is to elect officials who would correct or replace them...  \nThe officials responsible for fair elections:  \nhttp://www.fec.gov/members/members.shtml  \nHowever because many conglomerates and industries unfairly lobby representatives...  \nThe officials responsible for corporate compliance:  \nhttps://www.ftc.gov/about-ftc/commissioners  \nHowever there are occurrences of clandestine collusion that obstruct adherence to the law so...  \nThe officials responsible for administering justice:  \nhttps://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure  \nhttps://www.justice.gov/ag  \nAnd the officials who are to evaluate them:  \nhttps://oversight.house.gov/committee-members/  \nhttps://www.govtrack.us/congress/committees/HSJU  \nSo identifying and rallying the people to pick off the vulnerable ineffective actors in these groups seems as decent a place to start as any because...  \nThe level past this involves direct action and would have to be spearheaded by military actors and therefore is ruled out completely by me (a foreign past-the-fist).  \n\nThese people are citizens, not gods. If something is suspicious with someone who is answerable to you, act as a [personable, law abiding] private investigator and reporter; Gather some basic information and talk to your peers about it. Frame these contractors in your mind & conversations properly, and people may act instead of dismissing the idea. They are supposed to be doing a job for you. If they aren't good enough no one is allowed to do it for them and they are put in charge of some important and impactful matters.\n\nThis sloppy idea was just an afternoon discussion between me and a friend attempting an alternative path to www.wolf-pac.com/the_plan. However the process of laying out such approaches can be galvanizing for political diehards. You might have a plan to limit compromised political parties or eliminate them or whatnot. \n\n5.) For those passing minor ideas: We could use a **Suggestion Box For Tiny Fun Public Interest Projects** like /r/Lightbulb to provide a voice and perhaps follow-through or accomplishment. Let's capitalize on our numbers and imagination. Public space on the net for example. Or a /r/politics poll mirroring the general election choices so that we can see how representative Reddit results are of the US citizenry.\n\n6.) And the really big picture: **A Long Term Social Engineering Plan**. Literally A Future to Believe In. It is my opinion that we should explore how we can amicably discover and agree on what important ideals and systems of acting we should communally support? (How can we all just get along?) There are some institutions like the Bilderberg group or the more recognizable and fictitious Foundation by Asimov that operate on this level. \n\nHere is where the tinfoil hats may come in handy... IMHO the TPP and the likes of SOPA seek to influence global society. NAFTA was partially responsible for enriching corporations by outsourcing jobs to cheaper locations. That contributed to a turbulent rebalancing of economic power. The TPP attempts to partially counter this at an unacceptable cost of allowing corporations to sue nations and firm entrenchment of an oligarchy. It is problematic that the size of groups surpass their leader's ability to identify with specific individuals therein. (See www.en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar's_number). Okay, it's safe to remove the metallic headgear now.\n\nIn just three generations (two when multiple forms of media are brought to bear) a population can be convinced that the way they are taught society operates is proper. Even if it's detrimental to civilization. This also means there are methods to grandly and beneficially shape society. From history I doubt the ability and will of those in power to do so without input from and transparency to the populous. There is no reason (aside from forced eugenics which is taboo) why we can't sit down and continue the conversation of how the half dozen hives of humans can transition and intermingle our cultures and resources in ways acceptable to the public interest. People are already doing it, both as an outworking of human nature and in attempts to steer it (think Sid Meyer's Civilization with reality): www.youtu.be/JMLESEobnFU?t=1906\n\nThe yin-yang tau; When chaos abounds there is opportunity, abundant order is constraining, this is the beating heart of humanity. This is the thing that humans do. It's part of our narrative pattern. From Prometheus to Jesus to FDR to Rocky, it's the story we tell. It's the story we listen to. It's the story we live. It is us. The question is what part do each of us play in it? And that will determine if this story is over yet, because let me tell you: This is the story of a victorious triumph that happened when the people came together.\n\nInspiring Summary and Call to Action.) Why settle for a Wal-Mart government when a Costco membership is only 27 bucks? Sure we might not be able to convince everyone that Ben & Jerry's is a great value but we don't need to stay with http://blogs.naturalnews.com/warning-avoid-walmarts-great-value-unmeltable-ice-cream-sandwich-cost/ to avoid having to eat rancid yogurt.\n\nThe goal is to have these (six for now) ideas accessible to tolerant developed nations with a liaison organization for logistical support and cross publication if wise. Government built to be used not made to be sold. I'm seeking feedback, input, and I'm wondering if there's a good place to coordinate with. Reach out if anyone wants to be involved alongside.\n\n[Insert cheesy yet heartfelt rallying cry like here like 'Not enough is not enough!'] \n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/gF6iiDF.jpg  \n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/l3nDANl.jpg",

            "selftext": "I don't know if this is stupid or genius. Maybe a little of both. Stupenius. That pretty much describes me, so we'll run with it. \n\nSo, half the problem with our entire political system is the existence of political parties. \n\n49% of people want chocolate, 51% want vanilla, everyone has to have vanilla. That's just fucking ridiculous. \n\nAnd then you've got this concept of opposition parties, whose mission in life is to be obstructionist, except, it seems, in cases of blatant corruption.\n\nParty policy tramples all over local representation, and reps *aren't allowed* to vote as their voters demand. So what's even the point? \n\nHere's my proposal: Scrap the lot, start over. \n\nOutlaw and disband all political parties. Everyone runs as an independent, on their own merits, chosen by their own electorate, with no allegiance to anyone else.  \n\nNow I hear your frantic objections: without top-down control, nothing would ever get done. With no party and no whips, negotiation would gridlock and stall, with everyone awkwardly bartering uneven chunks of quid-pro-quo and refusing to budge on complex multi-person agreements. \n\nThat's a very valid objection. \n\nBut!\n\nWe *already have a solution* to awkward, uneven, multi-party trades, and we use it every day. \n\nThat solution is called currency. \n\nNow hold your horses, I don't mean money. Money is bad. Money comes from all kinds of places it shouldn't, and goes all kinds of other places that are even worse. Money in politics is pretty much the other half the problem with our political system. \n\nSo we want tokens that can be traded for influence, that are in sharply limited supply, distributed according to the amount of political power that a representative should have. \n\nWell, there's your answer right there: **_votes_**.\n\nEvery vote a politician receives represents the trust of one citizen to represent their interests. If you get lots of votes, you should have lots of power. If you get very few votes, you should have very little power.\n\nTherefore, make votes the unit of currency for trading influence for the purposes of lawmaking - basically, shares in the public trust. \n\nEvery citizen gets one vote per election, which they transfer to any representative popular enough to get on the ballot. \n\nThat representative can then spend that pool of votes as they see fit, horse-trading N-way deals as easy as pie. \n\nYou want to pass or veto a bill, you just need to pony up the requisite votes.\n\n**_DEMOCRANOMICS, BABY_**.\n\nYou can't prevent it, so regulate and audit it instead, and make every transaction a matter of public record.\n\nHell, you could even tax it, with the feds getting n% on every transaction.\n\nNo more stupid riders on bills. No more nose-holding. No more partisan shenanigans. \n\nThere'd need to be some interesting rules around which votes can be traded where - for instance, they can go upstream from county -> state -> federal, but can only go downstream back towards their origin... but these are details that could be worked out later. \n\nI'm not sure where they should go after 'spending' them on a bill or veto; perhaps all the way back down to the original recipient. \n\nAnd you wouldn't even need the concept of people being 'elected to office' per se; the entire ballot would have a share of power precisely equal to their public support. \n\nIt would very likely be hell. But it'd sure as fuck be entertaining to watch.",

It would be a loss for those who want to hop in an RV and drive to Old Faithful, but tough -- these special places will be more special to those who reach them. Towns and businesses adjacent to parks will have to change their tourism models, but I think there will still be day trippers enjoying the areas near the borders.  We could start with one park (say, Yosemite).",

            "selftext": "Alright, so in our world today, we have made some pretty interesting creations. My idea is this: What if we could change the way people hear other languages? So I am thinking of a device, that would go onto your ear, like a Bluetooth Device, that would Auto-Translate other languages into your language. The way it works is the device would be somewhat similar to this: http://gimmedigital.gimmedigital.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/PS3_HEADSET_BLUETOOTH-620x350.jpg except there would be no mic, nor would there be a mute button. There would be a power button and there would be a charger for the device. Now, you might wonder what the point of this is if there is no way to hear other languages. Well, there could be these little chips that would be the size of a memory card for PS Vitas: http://cdn2-www.playstationlifestyle.net/assets/uploads/2011/10/PlayStation-Vita-Memory-Card-feature.jpg these chips would have a language installed on them that you would put into the device. Now what would happen is you would put in a language of your choosing, into the device, and everytime someone of that language talked to you, you would hear them in your native tongue. To make it easier to know which language is on the card, the name of the language would be on the chip AND when you buy the device, you would get a case that sorts out the chips. I believe with the technology we have now, this wouldn't be too hard to achieve, it would take a good while, but not impossible.",

Psychological functions are carried out by neuro-circuital systems containing myriads of Dopaminergic and Norepic subsystems; due to greater burden upon the microtubules due to excessive electrical signalling in the type of brain which is dominated by Dopaminergic subsystems \u2014 greater thermal, mechanical, or chemical burden (the exact type is not known\u2026 it is left to researchers to find out) \u2014 the microtubules break down**, causing Alzheimer\u2019s disease and other problems like stroke and depression.\n\n** Matsuyama in the previous millennium had already theorized this process (the breakdown of microtubules) to be the causal agency behind AD (Matsuyama, S S et al., Hypothesis: microtubules, a key to Alzheimer disease, \u200e1989).\n\nAnyway, my thesis can be downloaded and read here: http://www.xinxii.com/en/brain-function-and-dysfunction-p-363072.html\n(click on \"excerpt\", which is the full book... i thought that, in this case, better put saving humanity before profit :D)",

People could register their names and be put on a list of registered \"protesters\" (I use the term protestors but like I said they don't necessarily have to be protesting if they find another way to make change happen). At any major rally or event there could be people there to not only represent this crowdfunding system but also to take down names of who's there (as a way to reduce the amount of people who just want free handouts). \nWhat I've written here obviously isn't an airtight plan and some details would have to be hammered out but I feel like the base idea could work.

However, I think on a larger scale this could be interesting. Misunderstanding on both sides causes problems. \n\nTake donations, and put them towards addressing youth poverty and crime through charity, while also teaching people about the other side of the situation. \n\nDo this totally out of goodwill and respect, and allow them to still form their own ideas.

            "selftext": "If you don't know what an SRS is, then read up on it [here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition) Many schools have foreign language classes, but a lot of students have trouble remembering vocab from years prior. SRS programs are used to help foreign language learners study and remember vocab by spacing out the words that they know well and ones they are just learning.\n\n The only problem with these current SRS programs is that they have their own order of words going into the system. Websites such as [Duolingo](https://duolingo.com) allow for a teacher to oversee students as they progress through the program. If this idea were to be put into an SRS program, then a teacher could potentially be able to manually control what words students are working on at the pace he/she is going in class.\n\nAnother key feature of this program is to allow the teacher to input all of his/her own words into different levels. These levels may follow chapters in a textbook, the teacher's guidelines, or another source. By using this program, the teacher can set aside more time in class for work on stuff like grammar or conjugation rather than teaching vocabulary. Teachers could even be able to use this as a \"supplementary reading/program\" if they choose.\n\nLastly, this program should not be restricted to just foreign languages. Reviewing concepts in History, Physics, Math, Chemistry, etc. are all available with this program. Students that find themselves needing to cram or have trouble remembering stuff from 3 months ago will greatly benefit from this. If students are able to be supervised by their teacher through the program, then they'll be forced to study constantly while reviewing topics that may be on a major test, such as a state test, ACT, SAT, etc.\n\nThis idea just popped into my head after working with SRS programs to study and I thought that it would greatly improve the lives of students everywhere.\n\n**TL;DR**: SRS program customizable by teachers that can be used to oversee student progress and encourage studying.",

Generally, sober people know drinking and driving is dangerous an illegal, yet the moment they get drunk, driving seems to become a great idea and all their caution is thrown to the wind. They generally regret driving when they are sober, but are unable to control themselves when alcohol hits their bloodstream. \n\nThen I had the idea for a company and/or publically funded harm reduction program. What if there was a kiosk outside of bars that allowed people to pay a small fee (or pay through taxation) to lock their keys in a time-release deposit box? Lock your keys up before you go into the bar, come back for them the next morning. I know a lot of people who would voluntarily use a service like this.\n\nIt could also be done using a breathalyzer system rather than a time-lock system, allowing a person to surrender their keys until they can blow under the legal limit.\n\nI feel if people could make the choice not to drive BEFORE they start drinking it would reduce a lot of DUIs and deaths.",

            "selftext": "This is a label that signifies an album/song doesn't use auto-tune, looping, or synths. It's equivalent to the term \"unplugged\", except it allows electric guitars and basses.\n\nDon't get me wrong: I like some electronic music, particularly darker new wave and techno. But as I matured, it is beginning to sound fake and inhuman.  A lot of pop music is either boring or annoying.\n\nHere are some reasons for the labeling:\n\n1. To guarantee talent.  It's hard to tell who really has talent anymore. Auto-tune can make an okay singer sound amazing.  \n\n2. To guarantee great live performances.  Most EDM concerts consist of the composer playing back the song on a laptop.  Fun.\n\n3. Synths can be gimmicky. If you strip the average dubstep song of its synth texture, you are left with a simple melody on a repetitive beat.  It's amazing how melodically simple a lot of EDM is.\n\n4. To challenge artists to create more genres. \n\n5. To promote the development of new real instruments, such as the Harpejji.\n\n6. To make sure the music stands the test of time.  Rush sounds incredibly dated because of the 70s synthesizers.  It would be amazing with some violins instead.  Dubstep is already starting to sound like 2009.\n\n7. To give humanity back to music. DAW's have turned young composers into asocial computer nerds. The sounds they produce are sterile and boring, since human timing is a big part of real music.  Even the EDM pioneers Daft Punk used more organic sounds on their newest album, since they got sick of the brittle techno sound.\n\n8. A mark of quality, similar to \"organic\" or \"American-made.\"\n\n[Possible label.](http://imgur.com/a/vMR3o)",

Allow the first person to discover a planet to name that planet forever. The more resources a person collects, the more items they can build and customize, like buildings and cities or weapons. When a person is killed by another person, they spawn in a huge galactic jail where they dick around until another \"richer\" person buys them and sends them to a planet of their choosing. The newly rescued civilian is forced to live on that planet until they collect enough resources to build a spaceship and escape. The thing is, different planets have different randomly generated animals that attack humans at night, so if the civilian isn't well equiped enough, then they will be forced to rely on the hospitality of the cities on the planet. Over time, different cities will develop and be added to, creating large  metropolises in some areas with many undiscovered planets far away.",

            "selftext": "Hello everybody! So earlier today I was playing a video game called CS:GO as I'm sure some of you have heard of. A large part of this game are \"Skins\" which are cosmetic's that you can apply to guns. These cost real money (Although you can get some for free) and they range anywhere from a few cents to thousands of dollars. In my opinion it's a pretty good system. Both as a company, and for the consumer, which got me thinking: What about a store that uses a similar system. Essentially, you can buy items which could range from shirts, to video games etc. etc. But the real specialty comes into play with the loot based system. Perhaps you could get a free item when you sign up, but can't redeem it (And ship it) until you put real money in. With the real money you could simply pick out items to go into your \"Backpack\" which could all be shipped to you at once. Then, we could have a type of random system, where you pay say, 15 dollars, and you get a random item worth anywhere from 10-20 dollars. Anyway, let me know what you think of it. It's a pretty rough idea, but I like it.",

But this U.S. is much, much larger than other nations, which leads to quite a bit of conflict, as we have seen in this election cycle.\n\nWhat I am proposing is an organized nation based on those beliefs which separate and divide American society. Throughout U.S. History, it has always been North and South; there has been and still is a clear distinction between the two areas. What if we took it a step further and started organizing communities based on shared beliefs and values?\n\nI believe this would allow for people to live their lives how they want to around who they want to, hopefully decreasing small-scale conflict in communities. That's vague.\n\nThere are so many issues with it, though. The control-factor: do people choose where to go?; How are borders decided?; How to distance communities?; Who decides this?\n\nThere is also the issue of homogenization of ideas; this could lead to extreme belief systems that endanger other communities.  \n\nThis leads me to the next point of travel: If members of one community wanted to travel to an area within another community with conflicting values, would there be trouble?\n\nThere are so many intricacies to the whole thing, but I am curious as to what you all think about this.",

Just like our bodies create everything we need to function. And this pattern continues no matter where you look, I guess you could say only the perceptual outcome differs. I mean we obviously look different and act different to other Baryonic Matter creations.If you change scales, to our level from quantum, out who bodies are formed from tissue and flesh and bone. Almost the same way protons and neutrons; ordinary matter is is used. Toss in neutrinos or free electrons, dark matter, such as supersymmetric particles, axions, or black holes. and you pretty much have a whole person.\n\nI would strongly wager the universe is alive. We are simply a part of it, and it likely a part of something else. I would also say it keeps scaling, and could infact be seen as a multiverse theory. A body, or bodies withing a body or bodies, like an endless nesting doll. Same pattern repeated over and over, just differently. Multiple possibilities existing at the same time in the same space. All using the same building blocks, only scaled. Baryonic Matter itself may simply be the smallest nesting doll we're able to perceive. Made up of it's own form of baryonic matter it's entourage.\n\nIn which case I would lean towards this being a simulation, using it's own form of 1's and 0's..perfectly mirror our own limited understanding, as we are scaled copies of the same code, the same pattern.\n\nAnd yeah.",

            "selftext": "I know that there is already a pretty famous [ring clock](http://www.ringclock.net) which I would actually like to buy, however it is really expensive and i find that it looks a little bulky. My idea is similar, except it would have no moving parts and would look kind of like [this](http://img.youtube.com/vi/OA1iXxrX1Do/0.jpg). The main difference would be that instead of a digital clock it would be a binary clock with no seconds. It would have 5 dots for the hours and 6 for the minutes. The dots would be tiny -like the size of the notification led on most phones (besides iphones). The dots could be blue for on (or \"1\") and maybe dark grey or something barely visible for off (or \"0\u201c) and the dots would go around the ring like a band. Hopefully it would consume low enough power that the dots could remain lit always instead of just when you activate the ring. Ideally it could last a few days on a charge, but even if it could last 16 hours that would be enough because then it could charge overnight. \n\nI would love to be able to build this myself, but sadly i don't have the resources or the know -how to do it. I think it would look very sleek and hopefully low profile, and the novelty of it would be that you could read the time off of it and nobody would know that it is a clock ",

            "selftext": "So, me and the wife came up with this idea during a recent pillow talk session. It's usually when we come up with our wildest ones.\n\n**The Product**: Bottled human breast milk, batch tested for disease and pasteurized.\n\n**Production:** My wife breast-fed our daughter. According to her, you should only breastfeed about once every 3 hours. \n\nAs such, the milk will be drawn from mothers who can sign up for a contract with us. They will be paid by volume. The recruitment material will emphasize getting paid to sit on their ass and burn calories. Each mother is screened for relevant diseases before they are allowed into the program. The mothers are scheduled for single 15 minute shifts every 3 hours at the minimum.\n\nThe milk is drawn from each individual mother into marked and tracked containers. Each container will have a sample taken out for testing. Once they pass testing, they are put into storage, waiting for pasteurization and bottling.\n\nEach bottle will have the name of the mother who provided the milk (e.g., Tracey. No last names), and maybe a photo depending on marketing necessities.\n\n**Marketing:** We can go two ways with this. \n\nWe could sell to animal rights types by emphasizing the total lack of animal involvement in the production. Something about all our mothers are doing this with full capacity to consent, etc. Put them in nice biodegradable bottles, with design to evoke their \"I'm so green and nice to animals\" side.\n\nThe other idea, which is where I start to see dollar signs, is selling them to fetishists. As far as I am aware, there are fetishists out there who enjoy human breast milk. Now, I will sell bottles of milk to them at prices that are much higher than cow milk (seeing that I have to pay the mothers), with a name and picture of the mother on the bottle. If they like Tracey, they will keep coming back for more bottles of Tracey.\n\nThe fetishist market also gets around the whole social taboo thing about drinking human milk. Sell them at fetish stores or something. Pretty sure there are at least a couple million customers for this sort of thing.\n\nWhat do you guys/gals think? ",

            "selftext": "I started a project about a month ago in which I began adding excitement to the lives of my best friend's children. The girls are twins and they are both seven years old. I began by having my brother come down from New York, (I live in Illinois and they have never met him) and wake these girls up in the middle of the night. He has a very old dusty and withered letter and tells these girls how this letter has been passed down through his family. It had always been a legend in his family that a woman came to one of his ancestors and passed on a letter saying that she needed it to be delivered to a certain address (theirs) by a certain date, and whoever lived to that date has the responsibility of delivering it. This task has always been a sought after assignment in his family. He exclaimed that he was thrilled to have the opportunity to be the one to deliver it. He did all of this in an incredible Irish accent, with an amazing backstory. My brother is such an impressive actor.\nThese girls ate it up. They ate up the entire thing. The letter explained that I am a time traveler but I will not find out until I turned 25. I would never be able to control when or where I travel to, but when these girls grow up they would assist me in returning home and they would grow to help me harness the power to control where I land.\nThe girls sat in silence and absorbed every word. I was not there, I was outside waiting for them to return to bed. Once I heard my brother scream \"Now off ta bed with ye!\" I have done a few very small projects to excite them and they have kept their word that they promised my brother. That they would never tell me, not at least until I turned twenty five.\nThey haven't said a word.\nI need ideas to continue this project. Big or small, I have incredible long game but I lack creativity in this. Anything will help.",

You could then theoretically increase the price of cigarettes, discouraging the further buying of them.\n2. Cleaning the streets of all the cigarette butts you see on the ground. It's technically money, right?\n3.  While this might seem cruel, I think it might actually help some people. When walking along the streets, I see many not-so-fortunate folk, holding large amounts of cans. Essentially, they are \"self-employed\", for lack of better words, in the business of recycling cans.

            "selftext": "This is more in the brainstorming phase, but there exists at least [one website](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/) that succinctly lists and explains logical fallacies. This makes me very happy. I've started finding [examples](https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/comments/4yj0w9/taxes_are_like_a_subscription_to_your_country/d6o717e) of logical fallacies around, and I've been wanting to point these examples out, but feel like it would go unnoticed, or maybe even get downvoted (I tend to avoid arguments on the internet for that reason).\n\nI think of how grammar nazis have made redditers follow the crazy rules of English grammar, and I figure, if we can make a similar thing happen for logic, I think that would be a great step in making the internet a better place. I don't think it would stop people from being stupid on the internet, there will still be trolls, but if people stopped making bad arguments accidentally, the trolls would be far easier to identify. Also it would be a good way to deal with trolls imo.\n\n***\n\nI don't know exactly how to go about this, perhaps a subreddit where people can link to comments in which they've pointed out a bad redditer's logical fallacy, and then other people on the sub can come and upvote that comment if they agree that the fallacy was correctly identified (this doesn't break rules, does it?). Otherwise they could discuss if it's an incorrect label.\n\nWould that be a good approach? Is there another approach? Is this not a common problem?\n\n***\n\nEDIT: Just to be clear, I don't mean to suggest this as a means of winning arguments. I mean to point out fallacies so that people can start to recognize them more, and can understand each-other and be understood more easily. \n\nAlso I made /r/FallacyNazis, a prototype for how a sub like this could work. I think for this to be effective though, it'll need a fair bit of activity. I think though, that if the sub is strictly restricted to discussion of fallacy and not the arguments they're used for, that may help with the ad hominem / fallacy fallacies that may occur. Also an emphasis on the fact that people who commit logical fallacy on the internet are people too, and should be treated kindly.\n\nEDIT #2: My approach so far is tending toward a place where users just identify fallacies and then copy-paste a pre-arranged script with fill-in-the-blanks for the specific situation. Posts can be links to fallacies or potential fallacies that people have spotted for review by the community (to avoid false-accusations).",

So someone who will bond with your dog, take them on walks, see some sights with them, etc while driving them to your destination. A service where they have a personal connection with you and your dog, rather than services where they transport multiple dogs at once and keep them in crates with no one to keep them happy and confortable.",

In just 20 questions they can figure out exactly what you were thinking of and the possibilities of what you are thinking of are nearly endless.\n\nSo I am wondering why there is no equivalent for diagnostic medicine where a program asks you questions about a problem that you are having and then provides a guess of what is wrong and a recommendation (like potentially seeing a doctor) on what to do.\n\nThere are far fewer possibilities in possible medical afflictions than there are for the 20 questions game and people will be able to answer questions about their symptoms relatively accurately. The program could even provide pictures as examples for the patient to confirm or deny whether or not they think it looks like what they have.\n\nThis could save large amounts of money in the medical industry as the app could suggest effective over the counter remedies for obvious minor problems, where a patient cannot know on their own that it is minor. And the program could suggest seeing a doctor, and what kind of doctor, if it suspects that the problem is more severe.\n\nDoes anyone know why this kind of program does not already exist?

The characters in the show were drinking coffee in paper cups when they had coffee mugs proudly displayed in the kitchen...then it dawned on me (no pun intended)...they drink from paper/styrofoam because they don't want to wash the coffee mugs in the kitchen. Office kitchens can often be gross and the sink sponge extremely questionable...so, why not have dish washing wipes (similar to Clorox wipes) with just a little bit of dish soap per wipe, enough to wash a mug or two. The wipes would not be recommended for a full sink (especially if there were knives). ",

The nanny pass will be available for one nanny plus one kid, two kids, three kids, and 4+. It will have around 7-10 attractions and will be marketed towards parents to buy for their summer nanny and kids. It will be available year round but with a strong emphasis on selling during the months leading up to summer when parents are making arrangements for nannys when school gets out. \n\nWhat problems do you forsee with this project?

(Where are those promised classified 9/11 reports Obama?) What use is it voting within a system where nothing meaningful changes? There is none! There is no change for the greater good. This is the current state of the United States.\n\nAs a result, a lot of people are upset and angered by who we have as presidential candidates. Who selected these people? Who would select all these poor choices in the first place? Why is Donald Trump even an option? The system is corrupt. Plain and simple. Should we accept this kind of treatment from our government? No! There is no freedom in this kind of system! But right now this is sure as hell how it is.\n\nThere's two ways to fix the corrupt political system in American. One, a revolt. A violent but plausible solution to overcome oppression. But what I have in mind is more . . . passive-aggressive . . .\n\nWhat if everybody, on election day, simply didn't vote! This way the government would be forced to select new candidates and perhaps actually let the people decide on someone **we** really want!\n\nThis is the ideal scenario of course, but a more likely one is the pathetic and snide among us will use this as an opportunity to gain the upper hand for their favoured candidate of the ones presented to us. They would throw away the chance of something great! Just so they feel like they \"won\" their petty game.\n\nObviously there is a fat chance of this happening unless this somehow goes viral and people in America actually do as I say but regardless this is what I have to say. Better out then in, as the saying goes . . .\n\nNever accept the world for what it appears to be. Dare to see the world for what it could be.",

            "selftext": "This is just copied off my Facebook wall, had this thought while in class today:\nHere me out guys! What if we replaced the congressional branch of government with a direct forum where every citizen could submit legislation and cast votes (think reddit where most upvoted and hot topics rise to the top) I am not going to try to outline a detailed way for this system to be implemented, just the concept. With this system our legislation can no longer claim to be beholden to lobbyists and other powerful intrest, but will truly reflect the will of the people. Not a fully direct democracy as the executive and judicial branches remain unchanged. No more idle congress, no more legislation by the power for the powerful. I could only hope that the forum nature of the system would lead to information about each issue becoming more accessible and understandable as opposed to people continuing to rely on the news medias and making poorly informed decisions. Hopefully the political equality such a system would provide would foster a higher level of citizen participation in government. I'd rather put my faith in us, the American people than our congressional representatives. Think about it - hybrid representative/direct government.\n\nEDIT:I'm typing this on my phone so go easy on me guys :) Anyway some further elaboratation on what I envision. There will be no set date when people vote on what laws pass, rather when certain conditions are met it is automatically integrated in to law (think a certain amount of upvotes and perhaps other prerequisites that may be needed). Not every person has to vote on every issue, not everyone has time to. Out of this chaotic hodgepodge I think good legislation supported by the public will rise out. Let me know what you guys think, outline potential problems or areas of improvement!",

I'm just wondering if its a good idea and how efficient it will be.\n\nSo its simple, you set up wind turbines, more than you need to power the town.\n\nAll the excess energy from the grid is used in large scale electrolysis of water from the lake. Making Hydrogen and Oxygen which is stored.\n\nIf the winds die down, supply always has to meet demand in electrical terms, so you burn the Hydrogen in a thermal power plant, with the water produced cooled and going back to the lake, or being used as a humidifier for farming. And the spare Kinetic energy from the spinning turbine after the hydrogen is done burning is used to aid the grid as maintenance is done on the turbines.\n\nSo long as the math is right, the grid should work.\nCan anyone show me a problem with the idea, and where the inefficiencies will be.",

            "selftext": "Hello, my idea is simple: A card game that could serve as an accessory to a party (especially alcohol fueled) with crude and rather abusive (with members being completely innocuous during play of course) elements.\n\nBasically, imagine a few adults sitting around in a circle on the floor. One person (the dealer, who will \"go first\" in the game) is dealing all of the main cards to each person until everyone has an equal amount of cards in their hand. In the center, there are two small decks of cards (will be discussed later). Each person also has a die.\n\n--\n\nOkay, now the game starts. Everyone rolls their die except the dealer. The person who rolls the lowest number loses that round, but not without an enormous insult constructed by all other group members (except the dealer) hurled at them. How is an insult constructed? Each card that each member has in their hand has an adjective on them. Think of adjectives like \"dull-witted, dopey, thick, hairy, stupid, morbidly obese\" etc.. Okay, now each person picks a card with their favorite adjective that they think will be part of a suitable and hilarious insult to hurl (this is great when you're drunk or high!) at their friend who lost that round, handing it to the dealer. \n\nThe dealer does not pick an adjective. His/hers cards are just sitting on the side waiting for the next round when the next dealer (which would be the one who lost the round prior) takes initiative. He/she collects each card from each member and does NOT change the order of it. So like if member 1 handed a card, then member 3, then member 5 and so on... the order of cards would be: member 1's card, member 3's card, member 5's card etc.. THE DEALER DOES NOT MESS WITH THE ORDER OF THE CARDS HANDED TO HIM/HER. Also, the cards must be face down when being handed to the dealer.\n\nRight, now everyone has given their cards. The dealer then takes ONE card from ONE OF THE DECKS on the floor (imagine this deck of cards is colored white) and places it as the last card in the dealers hand. So all of the adjective cards (let's say they're tan colored) are on top of this white colored card.\n\nWhat is written on the white-colored cards? Words like \"dolt, moron, imbecile, fatass, ginger (yes, this game will go beyond the boundaries of race, sex etc so if you're PC this is not for you...), faggot (see?), atrocity to humanity etc.. (~~if this game manages to come to life, a \"mild\" or \"regular\" version will be released with the option of a politically incorrect version on sale~~).\n\nRight, so the dealer has the cards in his hand. The dealer says \"Jack (the losers name), you are a.. then he reads the cards, ONE BY ONE until he's finished with the insult. The insult is meant to be hilarious, evoking tons of laughter and finger pointing. For instance, let's say the dealer said to the loser: \"Jack, you are a foul-smelling, hairy, unwell, unkempt, despicable, atrocious, half-baked fatass\". Of course, the adjectives would be well better than what I just made up, but you get the point! The loser is meant to lose but not without a chunk bitten off of him, and people laughing at him. It's a game that might test your thick skin and fragility. It's crude, ugly yet hilarious at the same time and I think many games out there besides CAH fail to achieve that (in a good way, of course)!\n\nI have no energy to delve into more specifics in this game right now, so please ask away with whatever questions you have such as \"how does one lose\" and other stuff.\n\n**What do you guys think? Is this a good card game?**",

Has anyone read it and can give a general plot? Let's make it!\n\nAnyways, with the advent of theaters with eye tracking, this system could further be used to show the next parts of the movie. It doesn't have to be jerky like a crappy DVD menu because it absolutely has to be fluid if it is to work. If it's too close to call, the movie continues in a preset format.\n\nLet's take *The Wizard of Oz* at the beginning where Toto bites Miss Almira. Instead of this, let's have Toto growl at her. If the audience \"votes\" to have Toto bite her, they would look no matter how briefly at Toto. If Toto does not bite her, well that may be a different movie all-together then, right?\n\nThis way you can go back and watch something completely different! You would then get the Blu Ray to see what the movie was going to be had it directed itself. This would have worked amazingly well in the final/last Rocky movie considering the deleted scenes.\n\nThere are other options, perhaps a special manuscript needs to be made to make best use of such a format.",

Maybe you see someone on the subway, or stuck in gridlock traffic and you see someone attractive in a car one lane over.\n\nOr perhaps the situation prevents you from flirting. Maybe you\u2019re with family and don\u2019t want to hit on someone in front of your parents. Or maybe you\u2019re with your significant other and feel like opening up new options.\n\nThis app makes profiles visible only when you\u2019re within about 50 feet of another user.  When someone is in range, say the same room or whatever, your phone dings.  You can check the face and if you think they\u2019re cute you can send them a like. Then you can quickly make eye contact and decide if you want to \u2018Friend\u2019 eachother so you can message or meet later. \n\nHow is this different from other dating apps?  And why are profiles only viewable within 50 feet? The limited range means you have to check eachother out in-person.  You aren't presented with a list of hundreds of random would-be suitors.  \n\nIt also eliminates fake profile photos (unless they commute to work wearing a Mission Impossible mask) and also the need to verify accounts. And it lets you actually see the person so you can make a better judgment. \n\nhttp://jonjonmackey82.tumblr.com/post/149653907508/eyecontact-dating-app",

That way, businesses can attract your custom by offering to add to your donation.\n\nRather than giving a certain amount each time, you could give in proportion to the transaction.

You could even donate to things you pay tax for now, such as schools and roads, and vote for governments that will accept these donations against taxes owed. Eventually, with enough money going directly to public services, we might not need centralised government. And if donations go across national borders, we might stop needing those too as countries become more equal. \n\nThe more people giving more money away to more things, the more equal we'll be.\n\nI'm writing software to help make all this easier to do.

One faces forward toward the target and one faces aft toward the shooter. Audio and video are constantly recording and discarded like this audio playback [wrist device.](http://kaptureaudio.com/) Only when the trigger is pulled does the smart gun save the last two minutes of audio/video footage. It wouldn't replace body cameras since it would only come into play during a shooting, but it would supplement them. Of course the cameras wouldn't be so useful in the dark but hey they're bound to get something useful often enough to be worth while.\n\nI envision this as an add-on device that can attach to an existing gun in the form of a replacement grip with a small pod that sticks up to the right of the gun's slide so it doesn't get in the way of aim or handling it. The battery, control board and memory go in the grip and the mic and cameras go in the little pod. Instead of wiring into the trigger, the mic can go by the decibel spike from the gun's discharge.\n\nThe device could also have the usual suite of sensors you can find in any smart phone like GPS, pedometer (more useful to record running vs walking in the minutes before a shooting) accelerometer (useful for speed the gun was drawn from the holster) and whatever tool lets my phone work as a surprisingly accurate spirit level. The recording could also be activated by the sudden vibration of a discharge with these extra tools built in.",

            "selftext": "**Idea:**  Uber and Lyft should use their services in disaster situations to aid with rescues.  \n\n**Examples of self and co-rescue:** During the latest flooding in the South civilians with boats began rescuing themselves and neighbors; \"The Cajun Navy\" was comprised of residents of the affected flood zone and the surrounding area using personal vehicles to rescue others.  During major blizzards in the North East a local Jeep club used their vehicles to get nurses and doctors to and from work, they also acted as ambulance services when traditional ambulances could not get to patients.  During an natural disaster, most people will be rescued by a fellow civilian, which is one of the ideas behind the CERT program.\n\n**Companies provide free services:**  Facebook activates a \"check in\" service so people can track loved ones, beer companies can water, etc.\n\n**Problems:**  The problem with self-rescue and co-rescue is a lack of coordination.  Companies that provide material support, such as water, do so through FEMA or another agency that coordinates the efforts.  Distributed rescue operations can lead to an overlap in services as someone who has called for rescue is picked up by a civilian.  The first responders then waste time trying to find someone who is not missing and no longer in need of rescue.  One proposal to address this was to license private responders, such as \"The Cajun Navy\", this proposal has been met with resistance and may end up hindering those with abilities and equipment from helping others.\n\n**Proposal:**  Services like Lyft and Uber already have the infrastructure and mapping ability to greatly accelerate and streamline rescue operations or transportation in severe weather events.  During such an event, Uber and Lyft could turn on an Emergency Mode for their services that would allow individuals to \"hail\" for rescue and civilian responders to match the right person and gear to that rescue without overlapping services.  The entire map could be opened for monitoring to FEMA or other agencies through a specialized web portal.  These agencies would not coordinate civilian co-rescue operations, but could monitor them as part of the overall rescue effort.  If a civilian can't get to his rescue due to dangerous conditions (such as swift water, or flooding during a blizzard, etc), they can map that hazard and flag the rescue as high priority.  This would then be seen by FEMA or the appropriate management agency that could then dispatch additional resources, such as helicopters, to complete the rescue.\n\nDuring the activation of Emergency Mode for these services, all usual payment is suspended and anyone with an appropriate vehicle can operate as a volunteer.  Individuals with modified vehicles that would not normally pass Uber or Lyft inspection are able to operate and they are allowed to do so on the service for the duration of the emergency.",

            "selftext": "I have a great idea for a Reddit game show. The general idea of the game is that people are presented with post titles and they have to guess what the top comments are. There could be the top 5 or so comments and players have to guess as many as they can to win points. \n\nThe format of the game would be two teams of 5-6 people competing against each other for the grand prize. It would begin with one person from each team coming up to the center of the stage with the host. The host gives a post title and the two players on stage need to hit a button first so they can give an answer for what they think one of the top comments is. If it's the top comment they can choose the play or pass. If it's not the other person gets a chance to give an answer and if they get a higher comment they can choose to play or pass. Play means the game moves over to your team, pass means the game moves to the other team. \n\nOnce the game has moved to a team, one by one the remaining members try to guess the most upvoted comments. The points they get is equal to the amount of upvotes the comment has. If they get three wrong answers the game moves to the other team for a chance to steal the points. They get one chance to guess a remaining answer. If they get it right they win all the points, if they get it wrong the other team keeps the points. \n\nThis continues until one team hits 30,000 points.\n\nThe winning team gets to go into a lightning round where they send two players to the stage. The host gives 5 post titles and the player has 30 seconds to guess the top comments. One player goes at a time, with the other player in the back so he can't see the answers or hear the questions. If they get a combined total of over 15,000 points they win extra money. \n\nI was thinking about Steve Harvey as a host because I think he is really funny.\n\nWhat do you guys think?",

What I'm saying is, what if Netflix had a shuffle button that played random episodes from a pre-selected list of your favorite shows. I open up Netflix, and hit shuffle. Is it gonna play some Paris and Rec? Am I gonna listen to Raising Hope while I make dinner? Maybe even have channels, or playlists. Maybe I'm in the mood for some Law and Order. I'll put it on my crime thriller channel. That's crime thriller shows selected by me. So I've told to play L&O, or Criminal Minds, but no CSI Miami, or The Mentalist.

People tell me it is so because that is what sells these days. I mean are you serious? I didn't know we humans had that low collective IQ. Why can't we have a news channel that reports facts minus the drama? Why can't we have social movements that are based on scientific facts and where statistics is actually used the way it is supposed to be used? Why can't we have social workers who actually care about the cause and are not there just for the attention? Why can't we have discussion where the host 'if not equally intelligent as the guest' is somewhat intelligent. Intelligence level of a dog will do for now. What can't we have something on the level of FOX, CNN, The NewYork Times where stories are not written by hipsters with degree in gender studies? It has come to a point where even scientific stories are being written by people with degrees in gender studies. Why can't we have nice things? \n\nNote: I don't mean to offend people who have degrees in Gender Studies and are actually doing some meaningful work in their field. If you are one of them you have my respect. I hope you'll understand what I am trying to convey here. \n\nThere are only 6 news organizations and they are all owned by an oligarchy.

My problem with this is the same problem I have with product placement though: *we don't know the real source* of the rhetoric or stories or \"facts\". I'll gladly watch tv ads or adblockable ads for information, *knowing who they come from.*\n\nSo what if the shills put a little \"this comment was paid for by (insert campaign/company/organization)\" at the end of each comment or online interaction? They wouldn't be able to  screw up all the conversations the organization doesn't like, because if the others don't \"want ads\" they can ignore the shill. This would encourage shills to find relevant, factual information (using links to sources) about the organization, rather than being dishonest and troll-ish. It would create easy jobs as sorta amateur spokespersons too.",

Obviously this would be optional, and could be specific to UBER drivers that wanted to participate, but HOW cool would that be! I know that women would love this, and could bring more business who knows, let me know what you guys think!",

An interesting feature with this site is it also doesn't track your history and it doesn't block adult websites. Maybe I could sell it to Pornhub (lmfao).

That way, subreddits which have a bunch of mods won't be spoiled by a minority with an agenda. It'd be much more democratic that way.",

            "selftext": "Hi there! My name is Abby. I am a sixteen year old student from Ohio. I am highly interested in helping create a new innovation for prosthetics and would love your help! \nI myself have been in love with the thought of helping people my whole life. A very close family friend of mine was in a motorcycle accident when I was very young and was paralyzed from the waist down. My mother is a medically fragile pediatric homecare nurse, so I have been exposed to many different types of people. \nIf you have or are in need of a prosthetic, then I would love you hear about what you are looking for or what some good features for this piece would be. I am hoping to create prototypes for many different types of limbs, so there's not just one certain person I want to hear from. People of all ages are welcome too. My goal is to produce a device for those of all ages, but a main focus on helping teens due to the fact that I know how hard it is to fit in as a teen in today's society, let alone with a loss of limb or something of that matter. \nSome things I would like to know:\n\u2022 Do you prefer a stylistic prosthetic or a realistic looking one?\n\u2022 What do you look for specifically when choosing your prosthetic?\n\u2022 What materials feel the best and are the easiest to care for?\n\u2022 How can I make them more comfortable/versatile?\n\u2022 Please share any ideas or anything you feel could help improve any type of prosthetics. I would love to hear stories and first hand accounts to help better understand what is needed.\nMy goal is to create a prototype (3D printing possibly) and to get to a point where people can test them and use them. I want to go into prosthetics and ortho as a career and want to start taking steps towards that goal. Feel free to email at thedeejayclark@gmail.com\nThank you!",

Enter the drone. With a drone messaging service I could download whatever he wants and send it on a USB stick via a drone who carries it the short distance to his house. Of course, the technology could also be used for other light objects, such as USB sticks with pirated TV shows and USB sticks with German midget porn. \n\nThe drone would get its signal from relays placed on rooftops around town and battery life should not be an issue for deliveries within the city. Drones could be owned privately to be used by the messenger or the recipient or owned by companies/the municipality/whatever that would rent their service to customers.",

Key words: If you're paying attention.\n\n\nSo how how about some way to notify drivers of this kind of thing?\n\n\n\nSure, you can roll down your window and gesture for them to roll down theirs, while stopped at a red light, but these days, a lot of drivers will either pretend they don't see you, or get out their .45 and get ready to do battle.\n\n\nI'd like to see some way to communicate to others that something needs their attention, without any room for confusion or doubt by the person who needs to get the message.\n\n\nI wish I could come up with something more specific for a possible answer, but I can't.  You can't hold up a big sign with \"BRAKE LIGHT OUT\" in multiple languages...  who's going to keep a sign handy like that?  You can't put a LED sign on your car and be expected to activate a message without distracting your SELF From driving.\n\n\n\nBut there needs to be some way.\n\n\n\nRight after we come up with a solution for this, we'll figure out how to make people aware that they have their high-beams on when they should not.",

            "selftext": "Higher education shouldn't be a one size fits all solution. Why can't students independently study for their degrees? Like homeschooling there are resources, information, and state proctored exams home schooled students can take that allows them to receive a GED. My question is why can't there be an option like homeschooling for Bachelor level degrees?\n\n Something that is pretty cool so far is MIT OpenCourseWare. You can actually get materials, notes, homework assignments, practice exams, suggested readings, and even video lectures (All for free). The only thing about this is that the courses are not accredited and do not count for anything other than gained knowledge. What interests me would be if you could self enroll in a course or open online program on your own time, and then take a proctored exam at (local community college, High School, Library) that certifies that you passed the course. These credits could be applied to the degree you are working on.\n\nWhat students will pay for would be a small membership fee that would go towards keeping accurate records of what courses they enrolled/received credit for, links to resources, and course material. Other than proctored exams students would not have to pay for any other costs for being enrolled and taking the course.\n\nThis \"online school\" would not be for all students but those who are serious about getting a valued education, need minimal guidance, and are passionate about what field they are studying.",

So I can judge whether I should really try to make a prototype of it\n\n\nSo, as we all know sound is just a bunch of vibration on the air. So basically whatever you say is your vocal chords vibrating the air around it in a specific pattern in order to make that distinct sound of your voice.\n\n\nBasically, my idea is to transfer the energy  of the vibration in the air to vibrate a material which is solid and for that to happen we will need a material like our eardrum which can resonate with the whole audible spectrum.\n\n\nIf we can find a material like that, then we can then try to convert the kinetic energy of this vibration into electricity for use.\n\n\n*Problems/Challenges*\n\n\nOk... So this part is to list some possible problems which can come by so I need the help of you guys to either find a way to solve them or if not help me and add some more problems to the list.\n\n\n1. Due to loss of energy, the vibrations are not strong enough\n           Solution: Find a way to amplify the sound before it reaches the material\n\n2. Not enough energy can be collected at once.\n           Solution: Use the energy as a store rather than a active source\n\n\nHope you guys can help me out and think of more ;)",

            "selftext": "So, imagine you wrote a note for yourself for you to read in the future. It says the current time and date of yourself as well as your location. Then, you simply wait in this location for yourself from the future to time-travel back to visit you. You keep waiting, but they don't come. So, after a while, you give up waiting and go home. On the way home, you go past a bin. You're about to throw away the note, but then you realise that if you threw away the note, the obvious explanation that yourself from the future didn't come was because the note didn't exist, so they didn't know when to travel back to. But, if you kept the note, there would be no explanation for why they didn't come in the first place, since the note would exist when time-travel did.\n\nUnless... time travel didn't exist in your lifetime, or in the lifetime of the note. However, if this was the case, it'd still be possible to get someone from the future to time travel to you using this method:\n\n1. Write a note saying the current time, date and location of yourself.\n2. Keep this note for your whole life, or until time travel exists.\n3. If time travel does not exist in your lifetime, give the note to another member in your family, and tell them to keep giving it to others in all the years to come until time travel exists. Make sure they tell whoever they give the note to, to do the same thing.\n4. If the note wasn't destroyed and someone from the future chose to time-travel back to the date and time on the note, then make sure to steal their teleporter, or ask them for a spare one, as well as a user manual or any instructions.\n5. Once you have the teleporter, congratulations! You have skipped many generations of invention and innovation, so make sure to use the coming generations to do even greater things.\n",

The legs are made of cheap plastic, so what the hell, I thought it might be time to get a new chair.\n\nBut dear lord, do new chairs cost a pretty penny. After almost pulling the trigger on a brand new Serta chair, I decided to see if chairs are serviceable. I came across [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Hvb4gdI_j0).\n\nLook, I don't give a flying fuck about office chairs. But look at how he so gently coaxes the chair apart (another video had a younger dude hammering the leg off). His soothing voice guides you through the process.\n\nI think modern society is way too quick to throw stuff out when it breaks. A lot of us go to YouTube now to learn new things, and the old guys with a literal gold mine of knowledge aren't exactly YouTube's primary base of creators. It will be a goddamned shame if they die off without passing the knowledge on.\n\nI think there needs to be a channel, if not an entirely separate site, dedicated to finding these old guys, and filming their knowledge for posterity. Topics can range from fixing stuff, trade work (carpentry, metalwork, home improvement, whatever), or even just general tricks that we call \"life hacks\" these days.\n\nThe goal is to make the videos feel like your grandpa showing you how its done.",

A lot of my clients asked me to build online calculator tailored for their business. For example, the accounting firm wants a take-home pay/simple tax planning calculator; the divorce lawyer wants a calculator for child support and spousal support payments (of course just for illustration purpose, there is no straight guideline for this sort of calculation); the mortgage broker wants a simple mortgage calculator that maps out the lease payments and the principal vs interest portion.\n\nAll these are simple calculators supplemental to their business. I am thinking maybe it would be a good idea to develop an API that has all these sorts of calculators. The users of the API can simply embed some Javascript code in their website that calls the API to provide calculations.",

The roof of the vehicle would have a nozzle connection, so when a car needs to get refueled, recharged, re-whatever; the station will directly connect a sanitizing solution to the top of the car which gives the interior a hose down.

He comes across an acceptance letter to Redwood County Community College, with an address on the envelope.\n\nA week later, Bigfoot shows up at college with a suitcase and his letter. He's assigned a dorm with a perpetually-stoned roommate, tries out for the football team and becomes the star quarterback, and explores art classes.\n\nOne night, in the library, Bigfoot is studying for a history exam when a girl in a drab green jacket and spiked bracelets asks him to reach a book on the top shelf. Handing it to her, he notices that the cover reads \"A History of Sasquatch Encounters: 1955 To 1970\". They begin dating (this is a good comedy vein because she's trying to research Bigfoot and is also dating him but doesn't know it).\n\nIt's also important that the show would showcase Bigfoot being friendly and polite, but sometimes comically uneducated on what human society is like (Like a hairy, 6'9\" Curious George). The tagline could be \"Big Feet, Big Heart\".\n\nMore one-off jokes:\n\n* Bigfoot sleeps in a tiny dorm bed, his legs hanging off the end. He's hugging an old, worn-out teddy bear.\n\n* Bigfoot goes to a party and outdrinks everyone, due to his body weight, and then wakes up hungover and goes to a diner to get a table full of breakfast.\n\n* Bigfoot runs by the Photography Club, and they all take pictures at the same time. All of them come out blurry.\n\n* Bigfoot checks out at the dining hall with a tray piled with like 40 hamburgers.\n\n* Bigfoot gets high with his roomate.\n\n* Bigfoot studying intensely for a math test, with tiny glasses on.\n\n* Bigfoot going to a Grateful Dead concert and getting pulled up on stage,\n\n* Bigfoot models for a life drawing class and demonstrates the \"stepping-over-a-log\" pose from the Patterson Film.",

            "selftext": "When I was a kid I loved instant messaging. Maybe it was the novelty of the internet in those days but communicating over IM felt like a totally different and richer experience than trying to get a point across IRL.  Maybe it was because I loved reading and writing more than talking but IM's gave me the opportunity to make detailed points to a receptive and happy audience. Now as an adult I've seen IM evolve into the standard and mundane form of communication across many social context. On the plus side I get to communicate more often via the written word but on the downside those messages have started to feel as intrusive and generally annoying as phone calls but more limited than calls because more than a paragraph makes you look crazy in IM's. I want a text messaging platform that is more about the attention to detail that goes into making a message and less about the speed of the conversation. I envision this app consisting of a peacefully and playfully designed home screen that by default is some sort of pleasant environment like a beach or a meadow with  sandbox interactivity (kicking up sand, moving around rocks, that kind of stuff). So on this home screen messages will arrive in quirky ways (like a message flying onto the screen as a paper airplane that lands on your home screen) with the option to not open messages or burn them or whatever other interesting graphical way of getting rid of messages. \n\nWhen I tried to explain this idea to my SO I thought of a helpful metaphor. Imagine there are a bunch of adjacent tennis courts with walls to high to climb but not to high to throw tennis balls over and into other prisoners courts. In those tennis balls the prisoners get in the habit of stuffing messages on with fancy stationary. Since they're in prison they take their time crafting the message knowing that they're not sure when it will be read (kind of like snail mail letters of old) the messages act kind of like long arc conversations of one off communications since the responses will generally not be timely. But I imagine the prisoners in this scenario would actually enjoy getting messages more than we do via text since the content will tend to be more interesting and important than \"eta?\" or \"what's for dinner?\"\n\n The graphical component of the main screen for the app feeling like a sandbox of your own where messages kind of show up in fun graphical ways like a message in a bottle washing up on a beach or something. What do you guys think of this app?",

Alot of the women i've encountered using these sites are into that, however i am not - I have nothing against ink however i aim towards dating women who are inkless and value their skin etc. \n\nAnyways just throwing the idea out there, If you make it happen pls shoot me a message!",

Society is clean and filled with magic like cosmetics, glowing trees, light beams, upside down waterfalls, you name it.\n\nOne day the main character gets teleported to a meeting in a room. The room is filled with recognisable officials and higher ups. It is revealed to the main character that he has been recruited to a defence program based on his skills and personality.\n\nIt is later explained to the confused main character that the entire world is nothing but a simulation created by past generations called the Nexus. The real physical location of the so called Nexus is no longer hidden and therefore the entire simulation is threatened by outside influences. \n\nThe character later wakes up inside a vessel located in a dusty dark room made of steel and concrete. The character notices how his cold body is made out of nothing but steel and plastic. His conciousness have been uploaded to a robot body which is a part of the nexus defence mechanism. The character later finds his way out of the room and stubbles into the vast wasteland of what is left of the previous world.\n\n***\n\nThe exact mission and threat is not yet decided, but the key is that the nexus inhabitants upload themselves into mechanical bodies in order to defend their simulated world form destruction.\n\nThe story is inspired by the Matrix but kind of twisted into the opposite.

There is a funny or sad subreddit, though it is solely about letters sent from prison. I got through the first 2 pages of searching.\n\nWhere I got the idea from?\nI just watched gif of the two bulls headbutting each other on the front page, and thought, that's sad. Then, I checked out whether there is a 'That's Sad' subreddit and there is, it just hasn't been operating on a daily basis since it was first made a few months ago. \n\nAfter that, I noticed in searching that there is no funny or sad, and that that means something else altogether from funny and sad, funny but sad, funny yet sad, and funny or sad letters sent from prison. \n\nBasically, the idea is, you can post video, pic, text, or gif of something either entirely funny or sad. The bull gif is the only thing I can think of right now that would go into funny or sad, and I know that because I said to myself, that's sad, when I watched it. I would definitely make a rule for no posting gore, wtf stuff (and whatever else like them). I definitively want to leave out a disturbing element because that would just mess with the feeling of sad or funny. You just wouldn't say to yourself, that's sad, or that's funny after seeing something, if there is a mix of nsfl with it.\n\nI probably left out some stuff, that I can't of right now.\nAnyway, that's it.

Other art such as literature is analyzed often in academia for themes, motifs, and symbolism, so why can't we do the same for television and movies? It would be community-driven, and people would be able to see each other's viewpoints and discuss them. I think a site like this would:\n\n1) help people understand parts of storylines that they might not have gotten,\n \n2) allow people to analyze shows and see different perspectives, and\n\n3) provide a community for people to discuss how they think a certain episode or film should be analyzed, as well as general opinions/reviews.\n\nI've seen lots of interesting discussions like this on Reddit, especially for popular and very detailed shows like Breaking Bad and Game of Thrones where there is a lot of symbolism.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Is there a site like this that exists already that I don't know about? Also, I know that SparkNotes does have a [film section](http://www.sparknotes.com/film/), but it's quite small and not as community-driven as the site I have envisioned.

They're both wearables. \n2. Smartwatches are more commercially accessible right now than smartglasses. \n3. Both smartwatches and smartglasses are more hobbled in their functionality than smartphones due to the size of their displays. \n4. Glasses can serve as a primary wireless visual display for smartwatch functionality. \n5. Augmented reality might be made cheaper in a smartglasses extension for smartwatches rather than a complete computer running in smartglasses. ",

            "selftext": "I came up with this idea when wondering what our civilization could do if we genuinely ran out of fossil fuels.  (or global warming got so bad that other nations threatened to nuke anyone using them on a large scale)\n\nWell, nuclear/solar/wind/hydro can generate all the electricity needed.  The trouble is using it to run mobile vehicles.  Assuming batteries don't get better (they are but if they didn't), how would you run things?\n\nWell, you'd go back to overhead power rail electric streetcars from towns and cities.  Same deal for trains between cities.  But what about tractors?\n\nBasically, there would have to be a basic network of overhead power lines making power available at various points on a large farm.  Then, the tractor would have to run on a thick, heavy insulated power cable that can carry the high voltage/high current AC you'd need to run an electric tractor, which would probably need 100 kW or more.  \n\nSo now you have the problem of the darn cable tangling up.  If the tractor wants to drive back and forth down a series of rows, the cable would drag on the ground and destroy the plants.  So there would need to be drone vehicles.  They would look like 4 wheeler ATVs and also be electric.  They would be smart enough to drive their wheels in the tractor ruts between rows and they would maintain a following distance to the next vehicle in the chain.\n\nThere would be 2 large cord reels on the drone vehicle, both with a big electric motor driving the drum.  Essentially they would play out or tighten the cable enough that it has a little slack but the bottom of the cable is off the plants.  \n\nThe way you do this is you mark the cable with optical markings, and you communicate via radio with the other drone vehicles.  You use LIDAR to or radar to detect the adjacent drone vehicles, recognizing them by markings painted on every side.\n\nKnowing the distance, you can calculate how much cable to play out, with a little bit of slack, and that's how the robotic reels control how much cable comes out.  On each drone vehicle there would probably have to be a small \"tower\" so the front and back cables come out 10 or 20 feet up.\n\nAnyways, I suspect gigantic banks of batteries will be a cheaper and more practical solution...  Or running the tractor on methane gas which you can make synthetically.  But I thought it was a clever idea.",

            "selftext": "Still using the ps3 and I'm looking to jump to next gen but a few things are holding me back. From looking around at ps4 bundles I have concluded that they all fail to motivate users(or at least me) who haven't made the jump to next gen to do so. The main reason why the existing bundles suck is because they don't address the problems users are complaining about who already have a Ps4. Which is why I think my bundle is one that addresses these problems therfore the only one to make sense getting. \n\nThe annoyances people are facing from owning a Ps4 are the following. Having to pay for online is a bummer seeing as how ps3 online was free. Secondly, the lack of disclosure on how all ps4 games need so much space to install graphics onto the internal hard drive makes having a 500 gig model frustrating to own if you have a lot of games. \n\nMy solution is for Sony to have a bundle that includes the following: ps4 slim 500 gig, 1 or 2 terabyte hard drive (that one would use to install into the ps4), 1 year subscription to Playstation plus, and 1 voucher for a game. I think the pricing  should be $400-$500. What do you guys think? Is this a bundle that would interest you? Would you add/remove anything from this bundle? Will I ever believe it's not butter?",

Every year is much more expensive than every other year that many consumers are used to.\n\nTheir advertised $32.41/month sounds cheap, but that's the cost of one upgrade spread over 24 months. Or put it another way, paying $777.84 per upgrade. Every year. Which sounds much more expensive than occasionally shelling out $32.41.\n\nTo rectify this issue of only being given one expensive option, a pro-consumer financing option would be made to cater towards people who want to upgrade roughly every two years. And while at it, a consumer-driven program has no reason to be Apple exclusive, since the lock-in serves no benefit to the consumer.\n\nThis option would be attractive enough that it'll seriously compete with Apple's program in terms of popularity.",

            "selftext": "Not sure if this is worth posting here, but...\n\nSome background info: In the New Jersey Plan, it was suggested that the executive branch be headed by a committee of people. As far as I know, there was no specified number of people in the committee per the plan. The committee was to be elected by the Congress, and the members could only serve one term and could be recalled by Congress.\n\nSo, I propose we implement a multiple member committee heading the executive branch. There are a few things I would like to add, though.\n\n1) There will be 3 people in this committee, each with their own cabinet.\n\n2) These members are to be voted on by the people.\n\n3) Each citizen is to get 2 votes in this election.\n\n4) No two members could be of the same political party (all 3 members must be from different parties)\n\n5) The top 3 popular vote candidates will fill the chairs.\n\n6) All current Presidential duties and decisions are to be voted on by this committee.\n\n7) The committee may debate a decision.\n\n8) At any time, if 2 of the members decide to put it to vote, there will be 15 minutes of allotted time for each candidate to express final thoughts, and then a decision must be made.\n\n9) Each member must vote on every decision.\n\n10) Decisions of a particular type will be allotted a consistent time period to make that decision. (Not sure about times yet, but a military decision might be limited to 4 days, a decision to pass/veto a bill may be limited to the 10 days allotted currently, etc.)\n\n11) If 2/3 of Congress votes to change that time limit for any bill or other Congressional powe to be presented to / approved by the president, they may do so.\n\n12) If no vote is called for after the end of that time, it would be similar to a pocket veto, but the decision can be revisited if all 3 of the members decide so, or if 2/3 of Congress calls for a reconsideration (only applies to tabled bills)\n\nSo, here's why I think each point is important:\n\n1) There should be multiple people to spread the power of the presidential duty, allowing for multiple opinions representing the multiple opinions of the people. Not 100% of the population has the same views, so why should 1 person represent the country?\nIt's to be limited to 3 because it needs to be an odd number and it's small because decisions still need to be made fast.\n\n2) the people must have the power\n\n3) https://youtu.be/orybDrUj4vA\n\n4) This I feel is the most important part of it, with the rest being logistics for the most part. This clause is put in to encourage the split of larger parties and give equal power to many different parties. Very important because many parties = many different choices for people to choose which they most relate to. Large parties would want to split to try to increase the chances to get 2 seats with similar viewpoints, but splitting too many times would prevent any of the 3 seats from being obtained by the original larger party.\n\n5) https://youtu.be/7wC42HgLA4k\n\n6) they are the new executive heads.\n\n7) duh\n\n8) As to not delay important decisions or allow for filibusters in the executive head\n\n9) There needs to be an odd vote\n\n10) Decisions need to be made in a timely manner or no progress will be made on anything.\n\n11) Certain bills or decisions will need to be made faster than the typical rule of thumb, and some are not as pressing. More pressing issues would be brought to the forefront. This would give Congress a little bit more power to rush an executive decision if need be.\n\n12) Basically, what happens after 11\n\n",

The last time I voted after insane amounts of google-foo, I still had only figured out their names and parties but not a clear list of their views. Bummer.\n\nSo there should be a app where folks can log in information about who is running for what, and where that matters to. Like wikipedia, individuals would also be able to report any false candidates or mis-information.\nThe idea is that you log in your zipcode and immediately see every office relating to you school district, county, city, state, and the federal offices that are up for grabs AND who is running for them as well as what their big views are. It could even list current office holders that aren't up for grabs in the coming elections, but list when their terms end. The app would give important dates to register by, how to absentee vote, and where the voting location is for that zipcode.\n\nAll of the information would be maintained by locals volunteering what they know and if it became successful enough, campaign offices would update the app instead of random locals. If something is reported enough, it would go to the administrators attention and they would then fact check it.\n\nIt's too hard to be an informed voter and it shouldn't be. It'd be nice if voting booths/locations gave out pamphlets expressing the views of those running, but they don't. This could work though but it would have to be big.",

            "selftext": "**Background:**\n\n-----\n\nMy town centre has recently had some fantastic development, which lets cyclists ride through it without getting off to cross the railway or river, and you barely even need to ride on any main roads.\n\nHowever, the station itself remains pretty cycle-unfriendly: the station bridge has stairs or a *very* cramped lift (I went cycling with my parents the other day, and the three of us could hardly fit into the lift with our bikes - I can't imagine how frustrating it can be at peak times) meaning you either have to have good balance and upper body strength, or wait several minutes to use the lifts.\n\nOnce you get on a train, it's even worse - the 'cycle compartments' are badly designed - they're usually supposed to fit 3-4 cycles, but you'll be lucky to fit 2 in there. There's usually nowhere to secure them either. If you can't find the cycle compartment, then you can sometimes stand with your bike in the 'porch' area, but you feel like you're in the way even at off-peak times and you're potentially a dangerous obstruction in the event of an emergency.\n\nIt's unfortunate, because there's so much development going on around other aspects of cycling, and if trains were better designed to suit cyclists it would strongly encourage an alternative to cars for intercity commuters, and also would provide a way for leisure cyclists to access their local countryside without having to spend half the day getting out of the suburbs.\n\nObviously it's a bit of a 'first world problem' - it's not something that's utterly necessary for my survival, it's just extra convenience. I think it would be received well as an eco-friendly idea though, and although there's no real way of knowing for sure how large the demand would be until it was tested on a small scale, I personally think it would become incredibly popular and fashionable as soon as people realized how convenient and fun 'train-cycling' had become.\n\n------\n\n------\n\n**The Idea:**\n\n-----\n\nSo, I'm not all that great at using my tablet, and paint would look sloppy and awful, so I'm not going to provide pictures here - hopefully my description will be enough..!\n\nFirstly, the main cyclist concourse would be outside the station - you would only pass through the ticket barriers a few minutes before your train was due to arrive, in order to reduce congestion on the station platform and dangerous bottlenecks. The ticket barriers themselves would be open by default (instead of opening only when you presented the ticket) so that cyclists could ride through them much more quickly. The 'tickets' would be stored on an electronic chip - detected by a scanner so that you don't need to dismount or hand your ticket to the machine as you pass through the gate. If a gate detected insufficient funds, it would divert the cyclist away from the boarding lane (you would cycle through the barrier fairly slowly and with a few meters' gap between passengers, so you'd get warning before you slammed into any barrier..!).\n\nThe station would be built in such a way that cyclists could literally ride onto the trains. There would be shallow ramps leading up to the station's bridge (single file lanes, possibly faster/slower lanes for people of different fitness/ability) and a *large* lift for people who might have difficulty with the ramps for whatever reason.\n\nThe trains themselves would feature two levels, with the riders boarding on the upper deck, so the station platform would have to be built accordingly (there could just be raised walkways for the cyclists instead of having to create an entire new platform for the cycle trains).\n\nThe main problem around bicycles on trains seems to be storage. In my idea, the specialized trains have two decks. The cyclists board on the upper deck, place their feet onto raised surfaces, and press a button - this lowers the cycle down into the storage deck, where it is kept until the cyclist disembarks. There are small (but comfortable) seats on the upper deck for the cyclists to rest during the journey.\n\nUnusual cycles (tandems, recumbents, disability-friendly cycles etc.) would be housed in a special carriage at either the front, or rear, of the train and would be given much more room - not only for storage, but also because dismounting could potentially be a lot trickier than standing there whilst the bike drops out from between your thighs.\n\nOnce the train arrives at a cyclist's destination, they stand on the raised surfaces again and press the button to retrieve their cycle (the surfaces are sprung slightly/raised enough so that the cycle seat doesn't slam them in the bollocks when it comes back up). They then disembark out of the train - the seats would be along the edges of a wide aisle, which would lead diagonally out back onto the station platform.\n\nThe area around each participating station would also ideally make an effort to design the station exit so that it leads directly into another concourse, and then to a cyclepath or cycle-friendly road. \n\n------\n\n------\n\n#TL;DR:\n\n- Cycling around is great, and the efforts to improve inner-city cycling are awesome, but travelling with a bicycle still sucks.\n\n- For this reason, travelling in this way is currently unpopular, but IMO should be encouraged as it's eco-friendly and encourages being active. \n\n- It would potentially change how many people commuted - more people would cycle if they could take their cycles on the train more easily, and more people would take the train if they knew they could cycle at each end.\n\n- It would also increase the availability of the local countryside for leisure cyclists.\n\n- My idea is cycle friendly trains where customers can literally cycle straight onto the train, and straight off it again at the other end.\n\n- The idea addresses the storage problem by having the trains be two decks tall - an upper level for passenger seating, and a lower one for cycle storage.\n\n- To ease dismounting/mounting, the cycles simply drop out from underneath the riders into the storage area, so they can sit on more comfy seats whilst on board the train.\n\n- Unusual types of cycles have their own, less space-efficient carriage at the front or rear of the train. \n\n- The stations would ideally link up with a network of cycle paths at either end of the journey.\n\n-------\n\nThanks for reading it, anyone that does! I only just had this idea but I feel quite passionately about it already. It might just be overengineering something that isn't really in all that much demand, but as I say, I personally reckon that the *reason* that commuting by train + bike is not so popular at the moment is *because* it's such a bad experience for anyone who's tried it. Foldable bikes are the solution for anyone who only has a few miles to ride at either end and can afford a second bike, but for anyone else, using a train as part of the commute is awful. Hopefully my idea would change that.",

            "selftext": "tl;dr : Create a new Godwin Point, called the David Point, for when an argument gets to the point when someone mentions \"rape culture\".\n\nI had this idea when a minister from my province reacted to an event during frosh week in my university. Here's a little context:\n\nDuring the Law Faculty's frosh week at University of Montreal, a bunch of consenting adults ended up in their underwear. Some of the girls present came out afterwards and said they were pressured into taking their clothes off to get points for their team during frosh activities. It was reported in big media outlets and our politicians felt the need to say something. The minister of Superior Education, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne David, said she was shocked by the news, and that it was a huge setback for universities, and that it was promoting \"rape culture\", and all that. Now, the minister of Women's Condition, Lise Th\u00e9riault, is threathening to ban all frosh activities from universities all across Quebec.\n\nAs \"rape culture\" becomes a more and more used term in the media and that speaking against it gets you labelled a \"rape apologist\" pretty fast, here's my proposition: create a new Godwin Point, just to point out that the person you are arguing with took a shortcut by using a buzzword like \"rape\" as a way to silence you (or to get political momentum, in this exact case). I would call that the David Point (Godwin gave his name to his creation, but I wouldn't want my name associated with that. The Th\u00e9riault Point would be more appropriate, but it's harder to pronounce for English speaking folks. That's why the David Point seems like a good compromise to me). \n\nThe point here is not to silence all those who want to discuss the problem of rape. It's just to make sure that everyone can point out (without being called out for it) when someone uses the word \"rape\" as a way to win an argument, therefore minimizing the actual struggle of rape victims.\n\nTell me what you guys think about that!",

            "selftext": "Ok so no sure how many of you have seen the movie Nerve yet but the idea of the app was intriguing. Ideally I do not see why this would not work the app is built on the idea of players and watchers the players do the dares and get paid for ones they complete.\n\nCouldn't this be a real app? setting up crowd sourcing for the players to get paid when they complete a dare? The app itself does not have to be created it could be used along side another streaming application and the players are informed on the dare based upon a tally system prior to each dare. Users could submit what they want the dare to be and in a certain time frame then those dares are then set into a list of say ten possibilities which the watchers could then vote on. After the vote is complete the dare is chosen and the player must complete it. The only issue I could see would be the source of payment but perhaps a few individuals who control the wallets of the crowd source are the ones who take the money raised and send it to the players upon completion. Of course the best method of payment to keep the whole thing anonymous would be something like bitcoin or some other alt currency. \n\nInterested in any thoughts on this seems plausible. \n\nEdit: I just thought about hosting you could host some kind of forums for the tally of votes and to get watchers players etc. This could be hosted on the Tor network using a bulletproof hosting service to help keep the game anonymous as well as the Users. \n",

The simulator is cool, but it gets boring after the 3rd flight).\nFor those of you that don't know, google earth has a 3D view that enables most major rural areas to have buildings, cars, trees, and other things that are given 3D Models. With this, i would imagine these 3D models could be imported into software that allows one to make a game. It could be a game similar to the Grand Theft Auto series, with cars driving along the road and people walking on the sidewalk. I imagine this game being first person or 3rd person, (with a birds eye view) where you would be able to purchase, customize, buy, or steal a variety of cars, boats, and planes. Another big feature this game would have is the Multiplayer. You could create your own character using preset options, and see your friends location real time. (Their location in the game, not real life) There could be mini games you would be able to play with friends like a hide and go seek game, a racing game, a dogfight game, a paintball war, the possibilities are endless.\n\nAnyone else have any suggestions or comments about this idea? please leave a reply!

Alex knows that individual neurons can't be studied easily. If somebody invented a machine that could study neurons more precisely, Alex would be extremely happy.\n\nDevin studies physics. Devin is a researcher studying quantum mechanics. Devin knows that a new particle responds extremely precisely to electrical activity. If Devin knew the kind of electrical activity neurons generate, he could figure out a way to measure them using this particle.\n\nDevin may eventually discover the importance of his research to a completely separate but equally complicated field, but if he already knew how necessary a new way to study neurons was, there's a much greater chance that machine would be built.\n\n**Example 2**: Asimov is a science fiction writer. Asimov writes about machines that produce energy from human footsteps that are layered into the utopian sidewalks of the future. His book is eventually forgotten, but the sidewalks idea is a really good one and Ben, a science fiction fan, records it in the database.\n\nEventually, technology gets to the point where creating these sidewalks are possible. Because the idea for them is recorded, Robert (An internationally-respected sidewalk engineer) now starts pushing his company to make these a reality.\n\nWe already crowdsource *knowledge* from different areas of industry, but we too rarely crowdsource *ideas* from different areas of industry.",

            "selftext": "Took a long drive this morning and saw two things a few times that completely screwed the flow of traffic and spent time thinking how to stop it.\n\nFirst thing I saw was people getting on the freeway and immediately shooting over to the fast lane and then accelerating. This caused a ton of braking and overall slowdown in the middle and left lane. Then there was their brothers in spirit who went from the far left lane all the way to the exit at the last possible moment with pretty much the same effect.\n\nThe other thing I saw a few times, usually when someone was traveling below the flow of traffic in the center lane, was two cars attempting to merge into the center lane from the left and right lane at the same time. Everyone around sees the possibility for a collision and slows down to give themselves lots of room so they don't have to join that party.\n\nSo what are the benefits of the alternating lines? First, it forces people get up to the speed of their own lane before changing to a faster lane. Second, it removes the possibility of two people from the outside lanes merging into the same gap in the center lane. Third, it forces people to pay more attention and think their route ahead and move inside as their exit approaches. Fourth it gives people passing a sense of urgency when passing someone to give it some gas and get in front of someone instead of a slow 4mph difference pass.\n\nIn my mind it would be two stages between most exits. When you get on the freeway you'd be greeted with a solid line to your left. This is the area you'd get up to speed if you didn't already on the on ramp and this is also the area people from the fast lane would start moving over for the next exit. At the mid point you'll get your striped lines to move to a faster lane and people can move over again for their exit. And finally between the exit and next entrance you'll have striped lines to your left and you can make it to the passing/fast lane if you wish.\n\nObviously you're gonna have plenty of people ignoring the lines altogether, I see it all the time with the HOV lane, but enough people follow the rules that I think it could make a big difference.\n\nThoughts? Criticisms?",

            "selftext": "Ok so i come up with random designs for stuff all the time, i usually just talk them over with my friends and family out of fear that someone might steal the idea, but most never really follow what i'm saying and i just get a \"good idea\" response... i've accumulated enough of these proof of concept designs that i don't mind shedding a few with the interwebs... it would be nice to get some educated feedback...\n\nSo onto the topic at hand... pretty much what the header says, using diethyl ether for geothermal power...\n\nto elaborate, geothermal power for the mostpart has been isolated to areas of high localized ground temps... but the lithosphere gets hotter the farther you go down regardless of where your at... specifically about 25 C hotter for every Km down, unless your in a really mountainous region...\n\nAs many know, the boiling temp for water is 100 C, household temp is 25C\nThis means to boil water you would need to bore a hold atleast 3 km deep just to achieve phase change to gas(the phase change is what holds most of that sweet PE)\n\nNow thats deep...but not too terribly deep, ideally though you would want to dig a couple KM farther to superheat the water, perhaps in a sealed loop separate from the turbine...\n\nI wanted to find a better heat accumulator than water though...Diethyl ether looks to be perfect. I looked over a table of a variety of substances, their boiling point, and heat of vaporization(kj/mol) (i'm concerned about kj/mol since we're dealing with volume not mass). to start, waters boiling point is 212 F (obvs) and its heat of vaporization is 40.66 kj/mol. Diethyl ether has a boiling point of only 94.3 F and a heat of vaporization of 26.17 kj/mol. \n\nso basically...it boils at only 34.6 C and stores almost half as much energy in that phase change as does water. provided we bored a hole 2km deep for our generator, the ambient temperature would be on average 75 C, twice the boiling point of diethyl ether, plenty high to superheat it and spin a turbine. not to mention diethyl ether is a commonly accessible substance. \n\nnow onto plant design... i'm torn between if it would be better to find a way to cram   a turbine down a bore hole and just send the harvested electricity up the tube, or route tubes out the top of some  at depth accumulator all the way to the surface and have the turbine up there...hmmm...\n\n\n\ni think my main concern would be conductive heat loss as the ether bubbles make their journey up the tube...I (think) this could be accomplished by say, overboring the holes, then filling them with a two layer pipe (eg 1 pipe inside the other) with a vacuum between them. the pipe segments could be say 100 meters long or so, capped at both ends to seal the vacuum. this would result in the only thermal pipe loss occurring every 100 meters across a minute surface of metal...insignificant if you ask me. \n\nThe at-depth accumulator would be quite simple... a large volume tank at about 2 km down, with the outer wall perhaps lined with highly conductive heat sinks...the accumulator tank would be filled with water due to it's high heat capacity.\n\nrunning through the tank would be a coiled or winding tube for diethyl ether, perhaps with metal heat sinks as well extending into the water. the coil would run upwards, with the main return pipe attaching to the bottom and the main pressure line leading out the top to prevent boiling running in reverse. \n\ngaseous ether would form inside the coil and make its way up the pipe. considering the relatively low temperatures we're talking about here, a pressure accumulator tank and valve may need to be at ground level before the turbine... so basically the main line would build up pressure until adequate, then the valve would be opened and spin the turbine. after passing the turbine it could coil down a condenser, change back to a liquid and down the 2km long return pipe... hell, the condenser could even \"be\" the 2km long return pipe... just do the entropy math and adjust the amount of vacuum and non vacuum lined return pipe so that the ether changes phase back into a liquid just as it reaches the lower accumulator again. similarly...no need for pumps here, ether is heavier than air so it would just sink itself down the pipe and even more so once it condensed back into a liquid. Once it got back to the bottom as a liquid it would enter a pre-coil accumulator tank, followed by a one way check valve leading to the actual heating coil. \n\nfor a new cycle to begin then, the pre-turbine valve would remain opened, and pump would pass all the ether in that accumulator through the check valve and back into the heat coil. the preferred unpressurized surface height of the liquid ether after this pumping would probally be somewhere at or just below ground level. this would benefit the ether-over-turbine valve dump because the ether bubbles forming in the coils wouldn't need to fight gravity, they would be buoyant in the liquid ether. \n\nOk so obviously there is no proof that this concept would even scavenge enough energy to run itself let alone populations, but discussion about it would be nice...specifically pressure volume changes of diethyl ether v.s. water... i know the phase change energy storage of the two is close, but i'm a little rusty on thermo to decisively say if a tank of 75 C gaseous diethyl ether would pack anywhere near as much punch as a 200 C tank of water of the same size...\n\nThe goal of this design is not to break the laws of physics and make free energy out of thin air... the goal of the design is to scavenge the thermal conduction of the crust at most geographical locations without having to dig that deep.\n\nconsidering its boiling pt being 94 F, out of curiousity i may try to make a little prototype solar motor... couple lenses... mirrors...tubes ect\n\ntl;dr I had the idea to design a geothermal plant using diethyl ether to spin the turbine instead of water due to it's boiling point only being 94 deg F and its high heat of vaporization. since it's boiling point is so low you wouldn't need to dig nearly as far (maybe 2 km or so down) to get usable heat.
