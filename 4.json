You turn on a channel and Netflix has its content on auto stream. \n\nIt's better than TV because Netflix content is more interesting and because there could be multiple channels...

            "selftext": "So, random idea I had while I was driving around a bad part of town and decided to pick up some McDonald's for some homeless people. When I was delivering these random sandwiches to people I noticed that it was pretty difficult to find anyone that wasn't around a shelter / food give away place. \n\nAfter driving around for a few hours I discovered how hard it was to find people needing food. So, I thought \"Man if these people could some how signal to the world that they need help maybe we could get the food to them\", but there was a disconnect between the homeless and people wealthy enough to afford phones.\n\nThat's when I had this random idea.\n\n**What if** you got your phone out and took a picture where you see a homeless person that has a location enabled feature that marks on a map that this person needs food. \n\n**What if** you did that and asked the person what he/she needed. That way you can write down on your phone and to the rest of the world what \"exactly\" they need. \n\nIE:\n\n* Food\n* Job\n* Over the counter medicine (ibuprofen / other stuff)\n* Even someone to talk to \nEtc.\n\n**What if** you could update the last time that person received food / help? Making sure no one is taking all the resources around them.\n\n**What if** we could finally connect the bridge between those who can't afford to call for help and those who can bring help.\n\n**What if** you where driving around and had a little bonus on your paycheck and you could drive to CVS or get some extra food to drop it off to someone that is in dire need of it. \n\nI realized maybe if we handed out a simple / cheap device that could signal to this app maybe that would make it easier for people that need help can get it for free. Just by connecting it to a wifi device or maybe GPS (AKA a coffee shop)\n\nA device something like this. http://imgur.com/HPyWRrZ\n\n**What if** help was a simple click of the button?\n\nI know my idea has tons of holes in it, but I'm totally down to hear anyone's opinions / ways to make it better. I have no idea how to make an app or even to program. I don't want to make any money from this, I just want to impact someone life that truly needs help. \n\nWith this idea you have two ways to get in contact with them, taking a photo of the area / person which would than have a location to the person in need. Or a cheap device that signals to the rest of the world that this person needs help. \n\nIf you have any good ideas or want to try building a program like this I would love to get in contact with you so please PM me and lets try to start this up! I'll give you my phone number and we can figure out what we need to start. \n\n",

            "selftext": "I kind of got this idea from the Squire bot they have over at /r/knightsofthebutton combined with the roo chain, but basically: a lot of subreddits have problems with reposts, but reposts are useful for people who didn't see the thing before. So we don't necessarily want to stop them, but we do want to expose them as reposts. So if there was a bot (maybe one, maybe one per subreddit) who could somehow tag a post with mod flair, and automatically (perhaps word order/word frequency, or a searchable unique flair database that users could request the mods to link) comment with a link leading to the original post/poster every time reposted content gets traction. So people see it but nobody gives the reposter credit for coming up with it. Maybe it's a stupid idea...?",

If not, think you are walking from A to B on earth.. you may take 5 minutes.. on the moon, you will take more time for the same distance.. so, more the gravity, less the time (may not hold true always.. )//\nNext, imagine.. there are 2 magnets  with different magnetic forces of attraction(meaning one can attract iron over long distances than the other).. say they are :  ana(magnet 1) having more attractive force than bonnie(magnet 2).. So if a robot made of iron is made to walk the same distance on both the magnets.. you will see the reverse of the previous scenario..more the magnetic force, more the time.. wonder why?(well think about it)//\nFinally, consider emotions.. when you are with a person you love/like/enjoy being with,  time flies..right? lets consider two girls ana(girl 1) and bonnie(girl 2), of whom you like ana more and feel awkward when bonnie is around (for some reason ).. suppose you are spending time a day with each of them, then you would have felt having less time with ana and a lot of time with bonnie even though you spent equal amount of time with both ..well that's it.. with all the fuss about time, space, relativity and all, well use these 3 concepts and manipulate time .. you will SEE THE DIFFERENCE!.. any one having hard time grasping it, comment..

With the popularity of post apocalyptic games like Fallout and the upcoming Mad Max, the area is a potential goldmine of content.\n\nSay Leon Kennedy and others get Intel that there's a new outbreak of irradiated zombies in the area and are sent to investigate. You could even revisit locations from previous games. Fight off bandits and terrorists as they look to claim the remnants of Umbrella's research.\n\nAll the best of the entire series, ready to explore in a single place. Something old, something new, ready to please *ALL* fans.\n\nMaybe co-op, maybe rpg elements, and maybe a versus mode where players choose between bandits, the heroes, and the monsters.\n\nIts farfetched, but a great way to push the franchise back into our hearts.",

Will there be themes? Maybe, that mostly depends on how creative I am (or you are!) to make a theme. \n\nThis thread is simple. Post a *pseudo-idea*, and see if where either you can take it as you're typing, or see where someone else can take that thought. Today it's not limited to anything in particular, just spout anything from the top of your head. \n\nHave you been thinking of something, but you just keep on repeating it in your head over and over again, leading seemingly no where? That's perfect for here!\n\nAgain, I don't know where this will go, so be sure to comment a shit ton and try to get this thread visible to everyone so others can contribute to the discussion!\n\n",

            "selftext": "Hello redditors, I have been thinking about this idea a lot lately, I realize it could be seen as improbable and weird to some of you but really think about the possibilities...\n\nOur current society is overflowing with bullshit of many forms. From the many constraining policies that only serve a few to the meaningless promises of lawmakers. The very principles at the core of the dominant power structure are without a doubt unsustainable and stifling for human progress, a complete overhaul is needed. \n\nWe live in an epochal time, the internet and other communication technologies are enabling the free spread of information like never before, making us more aware of how broken things really are. There is definitely a growing revolutionary movement but no obvious alternatives... why don't we create one? \n\nA good example of people using technology to bring things into their own hands is Bitcoin, at first I was skeptical of this new decentralized currency but now I recognize it's obvious perks... and many other people are. It's amazing how not too long ago just one programmer created a bit of software responsible for a market now worth billions of dollars.\n\nWe could create a worldwide nation founded on principles which are truly beneficial in the long term. EMPOWER the people; treat them like the adults they are, not children who need to be spied on. Next, MAGNIFY important issues instead of ignoring them, using the scientific method to find solutions not baseless conjecture and unfounded ideologies. Finally, PROTECT the environment, the people and the rights of individuals.\n\nThat's just a few of many possible starting points, there is obviously A LOT more to be established, but once that's done all you need is a database containing a collection of appropriate documentation/information/protocols and viola you've got the basic foundations of a new society. \n\nYou have to remember habit is the only thing keeping the world as it is, as soon as we collectively agree to stop playing the one-percenters game it's no longer a reality.\n\nA Cybernation may start out small with minor perks (more like a union) but the hope is that as people join the more power this new democratic state will acquire. The real turning point will be when resource providers such as farmers pledge themselves, then the rest of the world will surely follow. The powerful will suddenly find their positions worthless and there will be nothing they can do to prevent it, the government would be on our side, we WOULD be the government. This might take a year, it might take a hundred years, we might become extinct before it happens but it's worth a try.\n\nImagine a society where it's just as easy to vote for a new law or policy as it is to sign a petition online, your vote weight would depend on your proximity to the issue/qualifications but that still shouldn't mean people who live a thousand miles away or didn't go to school have no say. We are all flawed to some degree, we should vote for systems and schemes rather than human beings. Imagine an open source state, no secrets and no bullshit.\n\nEveryone could work to make a better world and actually feel like they can make a difference.\n\nWhat do you think? Too unrealistic?\nif not can u go ahed and make it for us allty",

            "selftext": "Your standard sandwich is a cylindrical, nearly-spherical mass which retains heat fairly well, and they wrap them in foil or at least paper before serving them.\n\nBut fries, which are essentially all surface area, no mass, they just throw in an open envelope and spill it all over the bag. (Onion rings are even worse, because they have an extra face of surface area cut out of the middle.) It's a minor nuisance if you're eating in-shoppe, but if you're getting a take-out order they're a foregone conclusion. And you can't microwave fries when you get home, either.\n\nWhat would it cost, an extra penny to keep the fries toasty and delicious a couple extra minutes?",

            "selftext": "It seems the violence we have seen after police brutality cases (Ferguson, Baltimore, etc) is the result of the local population feeling helpless and assaulted for a long period of time. What if there was a national network dedicated to two things: 1. raising funds to bail out anyone who reaches out to them after being profiled or harassed and arrested and 2. funding the collection and analysis of data for class action discrimination suits to force changes in how the police interact with communities. It could be a central clearinghouse (e.g. the Jacoby and Myers model) which then utilizes the already existing local non-profits for attorneys and bail processing and staff in the field communicate to the local communities simple steps to take to handle any police interaction and the toll free # to call to report a profiling incident and/or an arrest. If the police know the country is organizing to take this to the courts and if people know they have a lawyer and a solution more powerful than their individual resistance of arrest (and there there is someone to call to get them released from jail asap), maybe we avoid more deaths and finally move society forward by litigating changes to the system. Instead of marching and potentially rioting, take that energy to build the suits and force change. Marching makes good TV. but can we do something to make people feel less helpless in the moment and actually change things in the long run? Does this idea have any legs at all? Could someone with the energy and connections run with this? ",

            "selftext": "Alright, so we've all heard of E-bay, and know pretty much how it works. Companies or people can put items up for auction or sell for a fixed price, and provides users the opportunity to place bids on those items.\n\nE-Port would use similar site infrastructure, but has the opposite intent: It would provide users seeking a product or item a space to advertise what it is they want. Then, companies or individuals who can provide this product can post to that listing and compete to offer that customer the most competitive price or service.\n\nAn example listing might look like this:\n\nCustomer: I'm looking for a copy of Strange Tales #2.\n\nComics Connection: we can offer you that unopened, and in mint condition for $140.\n\nJustin P. Fakename: I have two, so I'm looking to sell one. It's opened, but still in mint condition, and I'll handle the shipping and handling. $130.\n\nCustomer: Justin, I see that Commics Connection offers insurance on every delivery. Do you offer insurance on your orders?\n\nJustin P. Fakename: I sure do!\n\nCustomer: Alright, post the link to the checkout and I'll send my info.\n\n\n\nI feel like for some niche items and other less common interests, the same niche that E-bay started in, it could really excel, and offers users a less search-intensive experience. That said, many online commerce sites have immaculate search functions, so it may be a non-issue.\n\nWould you make a posting on a site like this, if it was set up as secure and legitimate as E-bay or Amazon?",

            "selftext": "Disneyland is extremely crowded especially on weekends. I mean you're outdoors and you can't even walk like a normal person. Have you ever been to a crowded nightclub and you have to push and every step you're constantly bumping into people every step?\nI believe 10,000 is the maximum number of people they are legally allowed to let in on any give day. \n\nDisneyland should have designated days where they only let in half as many people, but *tickets are double priced.* You'd might also want to double the price on food, concessions, t shirts, gift shop items, those invisible dog leashes, etc, as you only have half as many customers on that day. \nCan you imagine how much more fun that would be? It'd be worth the money, and rich people (which southern california has a lot of) wouldn't care. Everything has half the lines and you can walk through the park normally at whatever speed you choose. \nIn fact, half as many people might be worth more than double the ticket price. ",

            "selftext": "Im not 100% fimiliar with reddit, but I would really like for my theory to be out there somewhere, so I figured this was the place.\n\nWhat if life was all an illusion? I've thought this for many years now and have worked on my theory enough to where I'm now comfortable spreading it. What if I were to say that you, a reddit reader, are dead? Some may scoff at the idea, but it isn't far-fetched.\nHear me out.\nOur life is like a whiteboard, but we're writing on this whiteboard with a sharpie marker, making what we do permanent. Now, with death, I believe there isn't a after life, that the after life we live is nothing but a simulation of our own lives. So, I believe when we die, we're left with something deeper than our subconscious. \n\nBack to whiteboards. We have our original life, whiteboard A, or just A. In this timeline, everything is happening for the first time, this is our original life. With death, after years, or immediately after death, our subconscious or something deeper, created this illusion of life using the memories of our past life. The \"Bright light\" we see when we die could be the bright light we see once we're born. \nOnce we die, enter whiteboard B. Whiteboard B could be a exact replica of Whiteboard A, an exact mirroring of our past life. Now, in this timeline, we will die again. Enter whiteboard C, and D, E, F, G and so on. With each whiteboard, things will change. Maye at first they will be small changes, and the longer we are dead, the more drastic the changes. But even though we die at the end of every timeline, we can still peak into the our other \"Whiteboards.\"\n\nEnter: Dreams. Dreams are a gateway into our past \"Whiteboards\" if you will. Sometimes when we dream, we wake up and we'll have a moment of deja vu. It could be that day, days after, weeks, months, years... whatever. Regardless, the moment when we feeel we have lived that particular moment and are so flabbergasted by it, it's because we have lived that moment. Maybe even thousands of times. \nIs there an end-game? That's something I've only recently dug into. Maybe in these different lives we live, our subconscious is looking for the happiest possible outcome. When it finially reaches this, we constantly replay that \"whiteboard\" over and over again, for eternity. \nSome may call this bullshit, some may call it Heaven... I call it a theory.\n\nIf you've made it this far, thank you. I've spent a ton of time thinking about this. I would really like to know what you guys think about this. Thanks\n\n(EDIT:)\nAs I am a high schooler, it's difficult for me to back up my theory scientifically. Thus, I have posted it here in search of some scientific assurance. I posted it here for like minded people to help me put some pieces together in my swiss cheese of a theory (get it, becasue it has holes. HA)",

This hurts all the apps, because with more junk than good stuff, people are more likely to get burned.\n\nAs a response, you have apps that offer freemium apps... which is effectively a demo, just more annoying because it becomes about up selling and ala cart to make up for the inefficiency of making the sell.",

But since X had a head start, it was about 100k downloads ahead of me and (since I kept track of it's downloads), by the time I reached 100k, X was at 500k ... even though my app was regularly updated and X hadn't been updated for like 8 months, it still had that upper hand just because it was more visible to people. As of today my app has material design, amazing features and about 20 apps trying to copy my success (not trying to be a self absorbed jerk, but I'm genuinely confident in the product I'm delivering and my reviews say so too)... And even today I haven't closed that gap because that inferior X app, that has now not been updated for almost 2 years is *still* ahead.\n\nThis is why we could use a completely separate quality rating.

Most of these adapters have a storage compartment like the one linked so the extra space doesn't go to waste.\n\nMany of these stereos also have Bluetooth to connect to smart phones, and a lot of smart phones have wireless charging where you just plop the phone on top of the charger, nicer ones will have a magnet that aligns your phone for best performance, and you don't have to plug in a cord.\n\nIf you're linking your phone to the stereo wirelessly, why run a cable to charge or keep it charged? Just toss your phone in the compartment under your stereo, and if it has Qi charging, it'll charge or stay topped off. A magnet will keep it in position over the charging coil. There's enough room for two phones, so you and your passenger can both charge without having to untangle any cables.\n",

            "selftext": "In today\u2019s world, it seems as if we check the labels on everything from clothes to comforters to food. The one thing many consumers often do not bother to check is the label on light bulb packages. To avoid selecting a bulb that does not provide the kind of light you want and expect, it pays to examine the valuable information provided with every light bulb.\n\n\u201cThe labels on light bulb cartons are mandated by the Federal Trade Commission, and like food labels, they are designed with the consumer in mind,\u201d says Terry McGowan, director of engineering and technology for the American Lighting Association (ALA).\n\nLight bulb labels tell you what kind of performance you should expect from a bulb when it is installed in your light fixture. In addition to factors like brightness, energy costs and wattage ratings, bulb labels also contain a plethora of information that focuses on the light\u2019s appearance, which is described in words such as \u201cwarm\u201d or \u201ccool\u201d and also in Kelvins.\n\nKelvins Count\n\nThe color you see from light bulbs involves two components.\n\n\u201cThe first component is what you see when you look at the bulb itself\u2014that\u2019s the overall tint or tone of the light,\u201d says McGowan. \u201cYou might look at the bulb and say that it looks \u2018cool\u2019 or \u2018warm.\u2019 That color characteristic is called \u2018chromaticity,\u2019 and for bulbs used for residential lighting, chromaticity is expressed in Kelvins, such as a bulb of 2700 Kelvins, or 2700K.\n\n\u201cThe second component is color rendering,\u201d says McGowan, \u201cwhich is more subtle than chromaticity because it involves much more human judgment about what the eye is seeing. Color rendering, expressed as a number using the Color Rendering Index (CRI), describes how lifelike or natural people and objects appear.\u201d\n\nNatural sunlight and standard incandescent bulbs have a CRI of 100, with all other light sources being measured against them. For example, if a bulb has a rated CRI of 80 or 90, that means the light from that bulb will not render the colors of objects or people as well as if they were in natural daylight.\n\nToday\u2019s new bulb technology, particularly with LED bulbs, means bulbs are available in myriad brightness levels and colors.\n\nAn ALA retailer can help you select the perfect light bulb to provide the best color and ambience for your home.

We had some melted chocolate from the night before, and an assortment of pitted and masserated fruits in the fridge.\n\nSo I got a bowl of melted chocolate, stirred some chocolate milk into it to keep it liquid-y, then poured some pitted cherries on top.\n\nIn other words, my-stoned-self essentially made a **cherry ripe soup.** (for those outside of Australia, [this is cherry ripe](http://www.pantryandlarder.com.au/images/s_cherryRipeSlice.jpg)).\n\nSo that made me think - what other kinds of dessert soup could I make? I could make custard-base, milk-based, or even a [tea-like, strawberry soup](http://www.wallpaperup.com/uploads/wallpapers/2013/11/09/171952/3b16e1f99f3f981860bb9203207da194.jpg).\n\nBUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE!\n\nNormally, when you have soup, you serve it with a side of toast or something, right?\n\nDessert soup would be served with **motherfucking shortbread.** Or maybe even French toast or waffles. THE CHOICE IS YOURS!\n\nThink of all the possibilities!\n\nDinner filled you up, but you still want some desert? Sounds like you want a water-based soup!\n\nTrying to impress your friends with a fancy, decadent new invention? Try some chocolate-gnache soup, topped with ice-cream and caramel syrup.\n\nFor when chewing is just too much effort when you're trying to maximize your caloric intake. Try new dessert soups, guaranteed to make all your teeth fall out or your money back! (thanks /u/JohnVanDyke!)\n\nDessert soup -- it's the next big thing.",

            "selftext": "Here's an interesting concept: Personalized media type filters online. I'm not saying filter bubble, but it's complex. \n\nWhat we need is a Wikipedia-style index, a Wikidex if you will, that sorts things among info, news, shopping, fun, tools, and nsfw. And the browser can deny ads and links to things that are nothing like what the user wants. \n\nWhen I go online for research at college, I want only info. Nothing involving jokes, no memes, and most certainly no NSFW, but I may be open to ads for books. Someone who's babysitting may let kiddo borrow an iPad, so they should be allowed info and games, but no shopping and most certainly no NSFW. Someone who's browsing for fun could block sports, nutrition ads, and news and get nothing but info or games or comics. \n\nIf the user can throw a switch that blocks access to these things they want to avoid, the Internet would be more effective and efficient. \n\nTo accomplish this, we'd need to think about two things: indexing and operating. Operating it could be done with another protocol. Indexing... How about a Reddit clone? People submit pages and sites, or a crawler I don't care, and people vote on what tags and why.\n\nI'm thinking mostly about search engines and ad systems, as they are the main method of finding things. Besides, the main idea is that by default, anything goes, but if the user is getting serious about what he's looking up, or other scenarios like schools, you can pick and choose a bit more.\n\n\nEdited for clarity",

Like sure I'm great, but you can say that to everyone.\n\nSo the idea is that people would keep little journals or something, and whenever someone did something nice for you, or you noticed something about them that was important you would write it down. Then every year you would give them the little journal of all the nice things you noticed about them. \n\nObviously you would say thanks in the moment as well. But I think it'd be a really awesome idea, not only make people feel better about themselves, but it also makes everyone more aware of how nice people can be and appreciate each other more.\n\nThere are obviously problems with the idea, but every problem I can think of basically happens with Christmas too. Plus it's a lot cheaper and harder to make it impersonal, you can't just buy a card that somehow remembers that on June 10th your mom did the dishes after you forgot instead of telling you to do it again.",

Since the size of the bottle cannot be set by the consumer, we are forced to buy a large bottle of soda and waste a portion of it.  Not only is this inefficient for consumers, it also poses a problem for the environment.  The plastic bottles get thrown away.  \n\nThis is where I came up with an idea for a device that dispenses soda or other beverages by a price per quantity similar to a gas pump.  The consumer can dispense however much of the beverage they want into a cup.  Also, the consumer can provide the cup which cuts down on the need to produce more harmful plastic products like bottles.  ",

            "selftext": "The current ESRB Rating System has many flaws.  One of these flaws is that the rating panel mostly consists of those not accustomed to playing video games and know little of the games that they are rating.  One solution to this problem would be to utilize two panels.  One panel would be made up of the current \"Industry Experts\" at the ESRB and the other would be a group of actual gamers.\n\nSecondly, the rating system itself would be overhauled.  The two panels would both rate the game's content in various categories with a numerical value.  Then, the two values per category would be averaged out between the two groups and the averages would be added to find the total out of 100.  A game with a higher rating would be more inappropriate for children.  Rating system explained:\n\n0-10: EC\n\n10-30: E\n\n30-50: E10+\n\n50-70: T\n\n70-90: M\n\n90-100 AO\n\nThis would also better classify games that exist in \"gray areas\" between the ratings, games like Team Fortress 2 that lie in between a T and M rating.",

The project is coming along well, until the AI computer which serves as their aid in the project (think Jarvis from Avengers) suddenly goes haywire, kills the scientists and uploads herself to the city's mainframe. Though it is unable to go beyond the city thanks to emergency firewalls, the AI proceeds to start possessing whatever robots, electronic objects and even humans it can find, and possesses them into destroying the forces which are keeping the AI at bay, so that it may release itself to the world and enact its totalitarian laws.\n\n>The city goes into lockdown, and the military deals with keeping the AI and its minions locked in the city limits, as their higher-ups are conflicted over whether or not the city should be destroyed despite there being humans remaining in the sewers and roaming the streets for safety and escape. Worse still, rumours float about of a political conspiracy that may have caused the catastrophe.\n\n>However, a group of the unfinished androids created by the scientists awaken at the realization of their fathers being murdered, seek to use their abilities to put a stop to the reign of the AI, investigate who made it go haywire, and keep the rest of the humans safe. In doing so, they befriend a set of rebel humans, deal with interpersonal conflicts caused by the AI attempting to certain members of the team, and discover what it means to be human on a psychological level so that they may complete their transition into actual human beings like their creators would have wanted.",

            "selftext": "College kids straight out of HS will find some way to be able to drink whether it'll be through someone with a fake ID, someone who is legally old enough to purchase alcohol, going to a frat party, etc.. However, by making it legal for college students to purchase alcohol, it would not only allow them the same reasonable freedoms students of the same age enjoy in other countries such as being able to enjoy a cocktail at a bar/restaurant, but it would also allow safer access not only allow them to purchase through legitimate means at a liquor store and  consumption at safer places such as a restaurant/bar rather than at a sketchy frat house where sexual assaults can occur. Not only will people be more protected from sexual assaults & rape but STDs and unwanted pregnancies will also be reduced due to college students being less prone to riskier behavior. Also, the legal exemption would reduce other risky behaviors such as binge drinking as students can consume alcohol in a more calmer, relaxed setting along with not having to worry about not being able to get more alcohol so that they aren't pressured to consume more alcohol in a limited time frame such as during a party. This would also reduce the amount of deaths related to alcohol overdose.\n\nWith it being required that they forfeit their driving licenses in exchange for a special ID that would allow for the purchase of alcohol at bars/restaurants/stores for those between the ages of 18-20, drunk driving accidents and fatalities will certainly be reduced. Also this privilege will motivate prospective college students in high school to place more effort on their academics so that not only will it be more likely that their educational and financial prospects will be ensured via acceptance by a higher educational institution such as a national research university or even a state school, it will make future generations of Americans more educated as this will motivate them to study harder while also ensuring a stronger workforce, economy, national security, and society due to people of the future generations being more educated. However, it is important that they'd be accepted to at least a state school, not a community college as the state school would at least be able to offer its students an opportunity to earn a bachelors degree which is essential for students to support themselves financially with a modest income vs an associates degree from a community college, plus the immediate transfer of a student coming from high school to a university has a higher means of motivating a student to earn a bachelors degree rather than through a community college intermediary where the likelihood of getting into a 4 year university is less so than straight from high school.\n\nIn addition, this will stimulate the US economy by adding more jobs to retail/food service industries as the demand for alcohol will certainly increase due to legitimate means while also boosting other related industries such as advertisement to market to a new demographic. Also, local and state governments will gain more tax revenue from increased alcohol sales that will allow them to drive themselves out of deficits while gaining additional income to fund government programs.\n\nEdit: in addition to the benefit of having their drivers license taken away, this will allow young adults to become more familiar with the effects of alcohol before they're given the opportunity to earn back their drivers license when they turn 21 in order to prevent more DUIs and related accidents & deaths.\n\n**tl;dr - allowing this special privilege to college students between the ages of 18-20 will motivate HS students to study harder to get into college, future generations of Americans will be more educated, less riskier behaviors and crimes such as binge drinking, sexual assaults & rape, DUIs, and alcohol overdose poisonings & deaths; stimulate the American economy while adding more jobs, and bring in increased revenue for local & state governments to get out of defecits while gaining funds for government programs and the governments themselves.**",

            "selftext": "I find it very challenging to read about all aspects of a specific current debate, digest the arguments for and against an proposal, and find the right questions with helpful answers.\n\nIn a heated debate like this, happening on the Internet, spread on mailing lists, reddit, and forums, there simply is too much information to be able to find the core arguments in reasonable time. It helps to read what influencial and/or vocal people have to say, and it sure helps to read upvoted posts. But in general I feel overwhelmed.\n\nSo, here's my idea. Imagine there's a system based on Reddit's voting mechanism. At first, there's a question: \"Should XXX be done?\". Lots of users upvote this question, making clear finding an answer is relevant and important. Then there are some replies, some arguing for the change, some arguing against it.\n\nReplies giving misleading or wrong information are downvoted and drop out of sight. Replies providing helpful information, maybe catering to the preference of a large group of people, are upvoted and appear at a prominent position.\n\nFlaws and missing aspects in a reply cause another reply, and upvotes take care to make those flaws visible.\n\nLong story short, if things work out as expected, the more users contribute the better the information gets. For the \"YES\" branch there is a top reply outlining the flaws, the same for the \"NO\" branch.\n\nI guess the main problem with this idea is that I expect people to be fact based, and only trying to convey facts instead of opinions. Upvoting an opinion only tells others that you like that opinion - but why that opinion matters is not explained. Upvoting a comment that expresses a valid concern or points to a flaw in the argumentation helps others see this relevant information, and maybe even helps finding the \"one truth\".\n\nIs it possible to have users write and vote in a way as described above?",

            "selftext": "## **What is the passion cocktail?**\n\nThis is a simple mixture which is designed as a *catalyst* of sorts to help a man seduce a woman. This is **not** a roofie but a simple alcoholic beverage which, in certain scenarios, will even help a potential target not land in an ambulance from alcohol poisoning if the individual is prone to drinking. It is also for all intents and purposes not designed to entice rape or any other form of forced sexual relations.\n\n## **So why is it called Vicious?**\n\nIt was named vicious after the 3 main ingredients:\n\n* **Vodka**\n\n* **Sprite**\n\n* **Sugar**\n\n**But this doesn't sound like vicious even as an acronym!** *Au contraire mi amore,* this recipe was designed by the Slavic masterminds of the Balkans and as such is actually called **V**odka, **S**prajt, **\u0160**e\u0107er, which, if pronounced correctly, sounds exactly like **vicious** (V\u0160S)!\n\n## **Alright, so how do I mix it and why does it work?**\n\nIt is very easy! You mix into a normal glass 60% sprite and 40% vodka, then you add a decent amount of sugar without ruining the taste (standard is 2 normal spoons). This combination will make the beverage taste good and also importantly, *addictive,* because as we all know sugar is probably the most addictive substances of all.\n\nSo how does it work and why is it important? \n\nThe sugar in the beverage not only makes it addictive, but serves a much more important role; Research has shown that acute alcohol consumption increases insulin secretion, causing low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), and can also impair the hormonal response that would normally rectify the low blood sugar. Drinking as little as 2 ounces of alcohol on an empty stomach can lead to very low blood sugar levels. This makes alcohol an even bigger problem for anyone with diabetes.\n\nSo how does sugar help? \n\nAlcohol is considered a poison by your body, and all efforts are made to excrete it, including the cessation of maintaining healthy blood glucose levels. Studies have shown that alcohol interferes with all three sources of glucose and the hormones needed to maintain healthy blood glucose levels. **Lack of sugar causes blackouts, vomiting and the like.** This is also the reason why in emergencies hospital staff pump patients with glucose and water. \n\nThis way you can keep your target well, but drunk, the whole time while exercising your superior seductive skills on them with much more effect! \n\n## **So how do I use it?**\n\nYou simply initially seduce your target and invite her to a drink, you offer her the beverage which she will hopefully accept, then you procceed to act as if you are mixing and doing skillfull stuff while actually blowing smoke out of your ass. She is amazed and drinks the beverage, doesn't feel the vodka too much but just enough that she knows it is light alcohol. Soon, after a few drinks, she will be yours (trust me 5 glassess of this stuff got me wasted, and sadly because I didn't drink it with sugar and water I ended up over the trash can)!\n\n**NOTE!** If your potential target doesn't feel well you must give her a glass of water, or several of them, since they will also calm the stomach. You can also do this sporadically as a kind of precaution.\n\n## **Who is to thank for this?**\n\nAs said, the Balkan masterminds are to thank, especially because of the several conversations held with comrades about the game of... Well you know.\n\nCredit: *I. - Majstor Biolog od Zanata and friends* (2015)",

Besides for the concerns of 'who is responsible for a death caused by a self driving car' (Which in my opinion can be solved simply by insurance... somehow \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af ) (See [This article for an interesting read on this](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/06/150615124719.htm)) there is still the very technical concern of self driving cars communicating with **ALL** of the other cars on the roads for all practical purposes. Instead of simply banning human-driven cars (Which **will not be happening any time soon**) companies like Google and Tesla (amongst many others) should spend their efforts on manufacturing a device that can be easily installed into cars for a relatively low price tag to enable even human-driven cars to communicate with self-driven cars (and possibly even other human-driven cars).  \n  \n\nI firmly believe that with the level of technology we have now, a device like this can be made to be relatively inexpensive for the common person. Also once self-driving cars are legalized, transportation can become much cheaper...

It's annoying and I want a fix. Doesn't seem that hard. I'm guessing the vast majority of honking is for non-emergencies anyway (\"fyi, you've got a flat tire\" or \"your tarp is loose\" or whatever), so there's no need to \"yell.\" Yet all vehicle horns are basically the audio equivalent of a person desperately flailing their arms and screaming. Thing is, a lot of times it'd specifically be better NOT to yell\u2014 y'know, like when it's going to needlessly surprise a person piloting a 4000lb death machine that's moving at 72mph. \n\nCouple scenarios to illustrate:\n\n* I'm outside my house and my friend happens to drive by (in her giant full-sized truck). She taps the horn and waves. Except, her horn is like a friggin 18-wheeler's\u2014 so startlingly blaringly loud I almost shat myself. From the OMFG EMERGENCY!!! sound of it, I assumed this driver was out of control and about to make me into paste or something. Not pleasant! \n\n* I'm in traffic today, merging. Somewhere well behind me, somebody honks their horn for some reason. Again, it was so loud that the person next to/ahead of me was (apparently) so startled they jerked the wheel\u2014 almost into my path. I get it; I was startled too. And I've seen it happen before. Which, grr. One \"excuse me\" honk, five years shaved off two people's lives. Not cool, yo. I'm tense enough as is!\n\nYes, it's a minor annoyance. But it's a minor fix!     \nAnd yes, people probably shouldn't be using their horns for non-emergency communications, but they do, and that's not changing. So *get on it automakers.* You finally got around to giving us a second trip meter and a second power outlet. Now I want a non-emergency horn. My car needs an Inside Voice.",

During this time you can open up a linked app and buy gear with the gold earned. This gear would likely be purely cosmetic since you wouldn't want to lessen the exercise with gear that made enemies easier to defeat. Once you have proven you are capable of higher intensity exercise with your XP, you level up and the scenery changes from desert to forest etc. and other enemy types and bosses are added.

Think of that, but for a charger. \n\nIt could be done one of two ways. The first would probably require a lot more engineering and innovation. Essentially, you'd have a charging station with a screen. You'd type in what time you're waking up, and it would create a schedule accordingly. It would either stop charging all together, or it would reduce the amount of energy to a trickle and back to full power alternately. \n\nThe second is much more simple. It would simply read the status of your batteries charge. Once it hit 95%, it would start charging again, and it would stop at 99-100%. ",

Imagine all the computer chips laid out flat and sandwiched between two heat sinks, where each sink cools the direct opposite side of every component. This could be a computer that's waterproof, air tight, fan-less, has twice the cooling, and of course the only maintenance required would be to wash off the dust. There would be natural convection as the warmer air rises. Thermal paste probably becomes an issue after years and years of use and it probably cannot belong here. So there should be a way to avoid using it by having surface contacts similar to vaporized metal condensation. Growing a heat sink on the silicon chips and then cutting it to specifications is an expensive option. It may be a better idea to condensate or grow heat sink material on the chips to the point where there is sufficient mass for directly welding on the rest of the heat sink.

A country has foreign policy problems and is doing something I find odious, lies repeatedly about it, blames everyone but themselves, state controlled media echos state statements, is known to have an agency that shills big on social media, has no elections, bad civil rights.  etc.  \n \nA redditor supports (I am assuming) his country and links to that countries embassy website, which has (unprofessionally) a joke on it insulting another country.  An intentionally obvious fake picture.\n\nLet's just say it was America that had that website.

            "selftext": "We invented money to solve the lack of transitivity in barter. If you produce a good or service with a limited market, barter fails because you have nothing to trade non-consumers of your product. The best you could hope for was to set up an intricate string of trades yourself to get from what you have to what they want, which is vastly inefficient. \n\nHowever with new Money! (tm), you can abstract this problem away completely. You trade your product for tokens that *anyone else* will trade their products for in return, and this whole thorny problem just evaporates away. \n\nNow, this is fine and dandy, but we have a similar problem in dire need of this kind of abstraction, and that problem is debt. \n\nSuppose you have a society where most people are in debt to someone else, and nobody's getting paid; B can't pay C because A still owes him the money he needs, and so on. \n\nSounds familiar, right? \n\nSo what if you drew a bigfuckinghuge digraph of every debt in the country, and went looking for cycles in it? \n\nIf A owes B owes C owes D owes E owes F owes A, shouldn't all members of the group (if they only knew about each other) be able to mutually discharge their debt to each other? \n\nYou could for instance stand them all in a circle and loan one of them a million dollars for five minutes. They pass it around the circle, hand it back to you, and they all walk away debt free. \n\nThere's probably an obvious solution to cut out the ridiculous theatrics in the middle... but the principle should stand. \n\nWhat if every single outstanding bill and invoice in the country were registered with a central registry, which crunched the bigfuckinghuge dataset, found cycles in the graph and mailed the members with a notification that their mutual debts (or at least a chunk thereof) had been short-circuited? \n\nThere's *undoubtedly* a much more elegant solution than this... but even so, why don't we do it?

With a magnetic engine, you could (theoretically) drive nonstop until you get tired. \n\nThe way this would hopefully work: pistons are made of lightweight magnetic material, and the spark plugs are replaced with a magnetic ball. One side of the ball is negative and the other positive. The Pistons are negative. The magnetic ball in will rotate to negative when the piston is at Top Dead Center, which will magnetically push the piston down. Once the piston is all the way down, the magnetic ball rotates the positive side towards the piston, which pulls the piston up.\n\nI realize it would take fucking strong magnets but in theory, it could be possible.",

            "selftext": "I was rather intrigued by the prospect of getting a spaceship or satellite to make maneuvers such as banks and rolls in outer space.  Conventional methods at the moment include small rocket boosters - but these eat up a considerable amount of fuel, and as a result, are limited in how long they can continue to perform these maneuvers before running our of propellant.  Additionally these boosters add a considerable amount of mass to the craft; as it must also carry the fuel necessary for operation.\n\nThere are a few popular alternatives to the usage of rocket boosters to make adjustments that have been posited over the years - thrust-vectoring ion engines for slight adjustments, and an electric gyro the faster ones.  I find in particular the gyro to be interesting.\n\nHowever, if there exists any severe engineering problems or limitations inherent to either of these methods, it's always good to have a few backup ideas, no?  \nOne such concept that I have been pondering these past few days is the prospect of an electromagnetically controlled steering system.  In the first incarnation, powerful magnetic fields would influence special blocks to travel down specified paths so as to hit a particular section of the craft, and thus transfer a considerable amount of force to the desired region.  For example, a roll maneuver would entail a curved tunnel stretching from one side of a ship's horizontal axis to the other.  Powerful magnetic fields would propel a special block down the tunnel; utilizing centrifugal forces to cause the craft to begin rolling when the block lands on the other side.\n\nThe second incarnation of the usage of magnetic fields would be to have a rather large central chamber, not unlike what one would expect a gyro-based ship to possess.  However, instead of a gyro, there is a slingshot-like mechanism whereby an object of considerable mass and possessing its own local magnetic field is strapped to a very strong elastic cord, and flung to specific sections of the chamber via generated magnetic fields.  The resulting force would be sufficient to influence the craft to change course.\n\n\nWhat do you think?",

We became entranced by the music and imagined that the room we were in was traveling through space and time, and the album was a story that we were at the mercy of. Basically, we were traveling through the album and describing what it all meant to us. I think that if this was done as a Youtube series in a nice sterile white room, it could maybe be popular? Have some intelligent people, maybe well versed in music and literature, (like my roommate and I) and have them dissect the album, song by song, whilst under the influence of marijuana. We want this idea to exist so badly, but we can\u2019t do it ourselves for identity purposes. We want it to be a very professionally done series, so if anyone can make this tree dream happen, that would be glorious. Maybe start with some of the albums from Rolling Stone\u2019s top 100? \n\nTL;DR; Someone should get high and then professionally record themselves explaining what some of the \u201cgreatest\u201d albums of all time mean.\n",

            "selftext": "Not sure where to post this so sorry if its in the wrong spot.\n\n\n\n**Preamble**(if you want to see the main point scroll down to **Proposal**): \n\n\n\nFirst off I'd just like to say I posted this to give an idea to help better educate the people and improve society. All criticism and mutual accordance is appreciated. Regardless of the reader's opinion, I would hope they may come up with an alternative and/or additional idea to achieve the same goal (which again is to educate and improve society).\n\n\n\nI currently live in the US so this idea may or may not be useful towards other countries and their people and is mainly aimed towards the US political system. I'm highly uneducated about every other country's political framework. \n\nI recently turned 18 yrs old and have been thinking critically about the decisions and future plans I must make for myself. One of which includes politics, or more specifically, voting.\n\n\n\nMost of my friends' knowledge of politics, politicians, and the real world are little to none. I of course am included in this large chunk of uneducated but eligible voters. Even though I want no part in power or politics, I understand to better my community, country, and world I have a responsibility as a citizen to vote not just for the presidential candidate but also my state and local representatives as well. \n\n\n\nI, as well as many others, am well aware I am inadequate to make such crucial decisions. For many it is difficult to self-educate the required amount of information for a large amount of candidates, domestic issues, and international issues.\n\nWhether it be because of time consumption, work/business, family, access to information, apathy, difficulty in comprehension of topics, etc there are many people who can't or won't self-educate. In many cases these same people do give their vote which is usually driven for the wrong reasons including: social pressure, background, (in many cases biased) media, looks, related non-political views, race/gender, political parties, etc.\n\n\n\n**Proposal:** An interactive program/demonstration created to evaluate candidates allowing them to prove their presidential strengths and weaknesses. All information would be available to the public.\n\n\nPresident has been struck through for if proven reliable the evaluation could be used for any type of candidate.\n\nI would not know nor would I recommend what criteria would be evaluated as I would hope the right minds would decide the paramount attributes of a candidate.\n\n\n\nEx: An interactive program that places the candidate in a realistic situation requiring them to make decisions triggering cause and effect results that the candidate must proceed to resolve.\n\nThe evaluation would be comprised of different scenarios, different political issues, and different variables that would change based on actions such as international relations, economic status, war/high tension, diplomatic relations, approval rating, etc.\n\n\n\nI hope this wasn't a complete waste of my time and at least got people of other nations and cultures to think about their responsibilities, communities both locally and globally.

It's about getting people back to work with money in hand more than hoping jobs magically appear out of austerity and corporate tax breaks.\n\nStarting in 10 years, every 2-4 years, a round of games bringing a steady influx of tourists, corporate money, and athletes and all their representative countries spending. \n\n\nPresently, the Olympics are having a hard time finding new locations for the games because they have a large up-front investment and then barely break even over the course of the single season of a game, while the stadiums and new hotels find little use afterward. Most of the jobs are temporary with little options for advancement or a new job after the games.\n\n If the games were a constant part of the local economy, there would be little fluctuation and a more steady flow of income over the long-term.

            "selftext": "I just had this idea and I have no idea how stupid it might be or if it's already been thought of.\n\nOne of the biggest problems with our meat supply today is that almost all of the meat consumed is farmed in CAFOs, huge warehouses where thousands of animals are squished in tiny cubicle-like things, and fed an unnatural grain diet. This leads to cows becoming much fattier, and having unhealthy digestive systems where they pass enough gas as to where the methane levels can actually reach dangerous levels. Grass-fed beef is more expensive to farm, and the land required per cow is also much larger. So CAFOs are generally far more profitable and can sell their grain-fed beef far cheaper than grass-fed beef.\n\nTo combat this problem, couldn't we renovate old or abandoned parking garages so that more you get more beef per square inch. Imagine a 10 story parking garage with floors entirely covered in grass, and cows being able to move from the ground level all the way to the 9th level freely. Water troughs would line the walls, and UV lights would hang from the ceilings to give the cows and grass enough light to properly grow. Hell, maybe solar panels could cover the entire roof and power some or even the whole facility. This probably wouldn't be the most attractive thing to do in huge cities, but maybe it could be used in areas where there isn't enough grazing land for grass beef farmers to be able to compete with CAFOs.\n\nAgain, maybe this is all stupid. I have no idea.",

            "selftext": "Not sure if this is the best place to present this idea, but giving it a try. My 'thing' is Post-Industrial Futurism and this year I've been considering different ways to communicate ideas about the emerging new culture to the mainstream. But it's a difficult subject to simply discuss, dealing with a lot of new language, economic theory, and so on while futurology as a general topic tends to be dominated by either the tired old dystopianism pushed by popular media or the psychedelic utopianism of Singularity Futurism. So I've been thinking about projects that would bring this topic to a more accessible level. Make it more tangible. Put it in a form suited to visual media like video. \n\nAn uncurrent to the current Maker movement is an idea sometimes called 'unplugging'; the notion that one might leverage open technologies of independent production on paring away dependence on the market system and thus recovering at least some of the time and freedom from our lives that goes to other peoples' profit. Some have suggested that a new kind of early retirement may soon emerge where Makers design their homes to be engines of subsistence, allowing them to reduce the cash overhead of their daily living to a minimum without the drastic compromises in standard of living typical of low-tech agrarian intentional communities. \n\nWhat might such a lifestyle be like? What would be different or similar to how we live today? What would the daily routine be like? How would one adopt this lifestyle and craft this 'home subsistence engine'? What would it cost in money or personal time/labor? What works today and what still needs work? How close can we get to this ideal? This is something I'd like to explore and so I've arrived at the idea of a documentary or reality show loosely similar to the many home improvement shows we have today but based on the premise of crafting and showcasing a home and lifestyle based as much as possible on Open Source technology. Everything from the house and all the furnishings in it to a car, energy systems, and modest scale semi-automated urban farming all based on open technology, on designs downloaded from the Internet, and made with the new digital tools of the Fab Lab. \n\nThis might seem a little far-fetched if you're not already familiar with the Maker/open design sub-culture, but in fact there are enough open source designs available right now that could make this possible. The cornerstone of the project--an easy DIY open source house--is actually something of an obsession for designers today and systems like that of the [WikiHouse](http://www.wikihouse.cc/) project have been around for some years. Being based on different materials, methods of fabrication, different means of acquisition, and a very different premise of design, open artifacts offer a very distinct aesthetic from that of the conventional suburban habitat. \n\nThe catch is that these designs remain very dispersed over the globe and the internet. So far, no one has tried to assemble them all into a turnkey showcase package--with the exception of the very ground-up agrarian-focused [Global Village Construction Set](http://opensourceecology.org/wiki/Global_Village_Construction_Set) of the Open Source Ecology project. And there are some curious omissions like refrigerators and other domestic appliances as their alternative designs just haven't yet occurred to the open design community. This project would demand a few new and bespoke designs too. \n\nI feel this could be a very interesting project and thus make for a very interesting video program. There is much interest today in DIY building, Tiny Houses, intentional communities, eco-tech, new gardening tech, and the exploration of new lifestyles. Here would be a project that not only offers all that but a journey into the future as well, giving viewers an experience hinting at what life may become as we move toward a Post-Industrial era. And maybe a bit of a 21st century take on Alone In The Wilderness too. \n\nWhat would be needed to realize this project? First off, of course, would be sponsors and a video production team. Then comes a place to put this showcase home. This could be either permanent or temporary. Or one could start in a temporary location and move to a more permanent one. We even have an option to build on water as open technology for floating buildings also exists. One of the unique aspects of open housing designs is that they are often demountable--as easy to dismantle and move as they are to build. One of the interesting things about architecture in the future is that housing technology is trending toward a disconnect of the value of buildings from the value of land, leading to a short-circuiting of the basis of real estate speculation in the 'improvement' of land. It might be interesting to do this in Greece right now. \n\nNext would be the fab lab; the new workshop of digital and conventional tools needed to fabricate everything going into this showcase home. This would include primary tools like flat-bed CNC machine for heavy sheet materials, laser cutter for lighter sheet material, and 3D printer as well as conventional light woodworking, metalworking, and electronics tools. Some more exotic new digital production tools might also be showcased, such as digital weaving and fabric making machines, DLP based 3D printers, and so on. Domestic robots of different sorts is another possibility, along with Smart Home features. The shop design would need to account for its use as a video studio documenting production. A new fab lab could be created for this project--perhaps ideally in transportable form using shipping container shelters or other temporary shelters then integrating it into the home itself, since that workshop would be a key element of self-sufficiency. But there's also promotional potential in production support from existing commercial workshops like TechShop or university fab labs. Perhaps a 'bootstrap' strategy where the transitional on-site shop and its shelter is started with a prefabbed 'beachhead' package produced by a sponsor shop. \n\nSome fabrication might not be suitable for a home shop quite yet. For instance, we can 3D print houses and cars now, but the large format 3D printers used are still too expensive for independent ownership and use. We still need a capability for high resolution extrusion printing using diverse materials and light compact arm-based robots with long reach and thus large working areas--something very close but not quite here yet. Depending on support, we might limit our domestic vehicles to bicycle hybrids, which we would likely feature in any case as they're fun and easy to make. \n\nWould we want to showcase family or solitary living? It would be useful to demonstrate the potential for individual production with these new tools and tech and a family home would, of necessity, be much larger. But from a video production standpoint a family might be more relatable. \n\nIn addition to the basic home and workshop environment, the project would also feature demonstration of urban farming, which is also often a focus of open design. Use of semi-automated hydroponics or aquaponics and Living Machine greywater and air purification is likely and a greenhouse or solarium integral or adjacent to the home would be part of the basic design. \n\nTrue DIY solar power, though possible, is still a bit of a challenge. Currently, such systems are limited to complex solar-dynamic technology or cruder photovoltaics based on organic dyes. (believe it or not, you can actually home-brew photovoltaic cells using cranberry or blueberry juice...) So it's likely the home would more extensively employ wind turbines or seek to integrate its farming and waste handling to power production. (ie, a compost-driven fuel cell system or some kind of biofuel production) \n\nSo I think this covers the basic idea without getting too carried away with details. What do folks think of the prospects for this?",

With correct parameters it should be possible to copy every kind of object. The problem is that it needs overwhelming processing power for computers to make such calculations without delay. But it must be possible to make so that cubes are limited to a small area that the player interacts. Then it must be possible for the computer to make those calculations one at a time without the need of a super computer. This kind of technology would surely change our gaming experience truly.

My idea is to make first gear like an automatic transmission so that you can be in first gear at a dead stop without the clutch pressed in.  Then let out the brake, and you begin to move forward.  You would then shift through every gear like normal, and still be able to sit in neutral or use it just like a normal manual transmission.  I was thinking of having a torque converter located between the clutch and the flywheel, where the clutch on the torque converter would be electronically controlled to only disengage when RPMs got too low. This would let you start off from a dead stop no problem.  You would also never stall the car if you forgot to put it in neutral at a stop, or if you let out the clutch too quickly. This would be great for stop and go situations, and learning how to drive stick, but still give you the fun of rowing your own gears.",

I say this because when a user, for example, \"blocks\" and ad on YouTube, the ad does not play, and the YouTuber does not receive payment for monetization. This is because AdBlock doesn't just \"block\" an ad, it effectively deletes it before it has a chance to show up.\n\nMy solution: AdBlock should just draw a black box over all ads instead of deleting them. That way they're shown and collecting money for the owner, but invisible to the user.\n\nPlease don't turn this into a debate over the legality of AdBlocking, I just want to know what you guys think of this idea.",

Also, is built in Wi Fi and webserver to generate the content of this special network.\n\nI try to explain better.\n\n* The bridge is a hardware that connects to the router and to the parent's computer.\n\n* It contains similar to \"project tor\" software, but safe and only for childs. It has a control panel for parents to manage children devices, also to monitor the entire network of all devices in the world to keep it safe. So if a \"pedobear\" enters to the network and publishes bad things, the entire community of parents can watch over and eliminate those things and ban the evil user.\n\n* As is integrated with a small web server, users can use Jekyll to create secure content for children.\n\n* Children devices will be disconnected from Internet access and use the secure network with the integrated WiFi.\n\n* Each device is a node. so it is a complete Internet.\n\n* It is made available under open source. So google can take the software and create a search engine just for that network.\n\nI think the domains can be .kid (www.google.kid, princessstories.kid, drawbook.kid, whitehouse.kid), but but TLD already registered, so the ideas are welcome. I do not know if this idea already developed, but I think it is a good idea.\n\nComments are welcome. If you have questions, do them so we can extend the idea. :D\n\nThanks.",

            "selftext": "More and more we hear stories about drones hindering firefighters and search and rescue attempts. One guy even shot down a drone hovering over his house. Could we develop something that immobilizes a drone without destroying it?\n\n**Description**  \nImagine a small version of a potato gun that uses pressurized air to fire small canisters the size of 3 rolls of quarters, side by side. The canister weights enough to reach a few hundred feet in the air but not too much so that it would destroy the drone it comes in contact with. Each canister is shaped like a rounded cylinder and is outfitted with flexible hooks that only extend outward after it has exited the barrel. On the front is a an umbrella shaped spire that snaps outward when a small amount of pressure is applied to the top. Think of those toys that look like a hollow sphere cut in half. When you flip it inside out, kinetic energy is stored until it \"pops\" back to its original form. Once contact is made, the front end pops inside out and acts as a claw that instantly tries to entangle the propellers. Same goes for the side hooks. The hooks then pull out, deploying the chute out the back end of the canister. Drone falls, chute lands it safely.\n\n**Market Potential**  \nIt would mostly be for mass market consumers, but could probably work better for law enforcement or some sort of licensing deal.

            "selftext": "I would like to tell you about gift-spending, an idea for a current (checking) account facility.\n\nGift-spending means automatically giving a % extra of what you spend in each transaction to a list of good causes you support.\n\nYour account would divide the % between your causes, and pool these (nominal) donations to each cause from all of the bank's customers, then the pool would be sent when it's large enough to justify any transaction cost.\n\nThis is also a better way to give to good causes than the usual \u00a3x/month, as you're only giving money away when you can afford to spend it.\n\nThe benefits of such a scheme are:\n\n1.\tYou could support as many good causes as you like, without having to worry about the cost of doing so. This means you can approach charity fundraisers to appraise what they\u2019re collecting for, rather than avoiding them on grounds of cost.\n\n2.\tYou could support your local farmers' market even when you shop at a supermarket.\n\n3.\tBy adding an extra say 40%, you could save and plan for your retirement with every purchase.\n\nGift-spending current accounts could be popular enough that businesses could try to attract customers by offering to go half-half on the %, and both could introduce each other to new causes.\n\nSince the difference between the good causes in the third sector and the public sector is arbitrary save for taxes, and these donations are nominal, things like the local library you borrow from, or the hospital ward that got you better, or even just the national treasury, become causes to give to. If government started to count donations to public services you support against taxes you owe, you would begin to have tax choice (taxpayer sovereignty), and customers would be shouldering the tax burden equally with business.\n\nPaying tax on transactions half-half like this is called the Automated Payment Transaction tax. A country's transactions are big enough that in the US, set at 0.35%, APT tax could replace all other taxes (http://www.apttax.com/). The people who have the most money tend to spend the most money, so they pay the most taxes. There are no tax returns to do.\n\nSo in the longer term, with this account you might be able to:\n\n1.\tGo half-half on your taxes with the businesses you buy from;\n\n2.\tNo longer have to pay income tax or any other tax except APT tax, or fill in any tax returns;\n\n3.\tDecide what your tax gets spent on (taxpayer sovereignty).\n\nI am sending this idea to all banks who offer current accounts. I'm also thinking about programming a library and demo wallet for a digital cryptocurrency to do the same thing.",

I would say most people could find something they would love to back on there but lack the money to do so. \n\nI personally hate seeing my taxes go to nonsensical things and governmental waste. When it comes to taxes at least for me it feels like they just take the money and I have no direct say. ( yes I know thats why we vote and have elected leaders.)\n\nAccording to http://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2014/acs/acs-28.pdf\nThere are over 80% of households in the United States have a computer and access to the internet. I feel we live in a time and an era were we can have a direct say where our taxes go. \n\nFrom my limited understanding when we work our taxes get split up into local, state, and national levels. I do not know the percentages but for illustration sake local garners 10% of your taxes State gathers 50% and Federal gathers 40% ( again they are arbitrary numbers) \n\nFor example lets say you had 10,000$ taken away from you in taxes each year. 1000 would go to Local 5000 to state and 4000 to the federal level. In this crowd funded tax payer system your money from your taxes would still get taken out each check but placed into a website where you had the ability to fund a certain idea. Your politicians at every level would pitch their ideas and if they do not meet the funding threshold then clearly they go underfunded or they are canceled. Or alternatively ( or in addition to) you can choose to back projects on Kickstarter with your \"tax money\".  \n\nI know not everyone is on the computer that much or does not have the wherewithal but this is a system in which you can voluntarily elect into. If you do not elect into the system then your taxes go straight to the government and they they do what they do. Or you can choose to elect into this kind of system and there would still have to be a 10% ( arbitrary) government sustainment fee to fund projects that are critical to the United States such as roads and infrastructure ( things people may not want to fund but is something that is needed). \n\nI think this kind of system would bring us closer to having a more true and direct democracy and we don't need the government to be spending money on projects the people do not agree with. \n\nI am sure I forgot some caveats and other details but I would really like to hear ( read) what people think of this. \n\nThank You.

            "selftext": "So I have been thinking of this concept for some time now and have tried experimenting with it a few times. But now I actually want to write a story based on it. \n\nIt takes place who knows how far into the future, and humans have left earth forever to settle on a new planet. Earth was eventually able to return to its natural state, and almost all traces of human existence is long gone, except for documentation on the entire history of the human race, which were sealed in the ancient ruins and left there before the planet was abandoned. This has given way for other creatures to rise and form their own societies and continue on earth where humans left off. Most notably birds and insects. *(Why birds? One they are my favourite animal, two they represent innocence, freedom, and positivity. Insects represent the power of teamwork and how seemingly insignificant individuals can work together to accomplish anything)* An arms race soon breaks out between the birds and insects, and being natural enemies, do not get along very well. As time passes, both species realize that in order to achieve what they both want, they must set aside their conflicts and make piece. So by abandoning what nature and instinct have always instructed, they do, and together with the help of documentation that humans left behind, struggle to avoid making the same mistakes we once did as their society advances beyond what their ancestors could have ever imagined.\n\nI want to focus on a time period when the birds and insects are already living together in relative harmony. I already have a few characters in mind and will focus on a group of birds insects who are close friends as my main characters. I want to focus on the themes of going against your instinct, friendship, and teamwork. \n\nI know this is kind of a weird concept but I really think it has potential. Only problem is I cannot for the life of me think of a reasonable enough conflict for the characters to resolve. If anyone can give me a few ideas on where I can take this it would be much appreciated. I will also accept any general feedback on the concept itself and any tips on how to write this thing. \n\nAgain, any advice you have for me I would appreciate, thanks!",

Inevitably, while you go off doing that, the person comes along, finds you not at where they expect you and gets confused. Sad times for everyone.\n\nWhat I'm proposing is something that lets you pin a message at a specific area in space, such that when its intended recipient enters that area they receive the message. It would be like leaving a physical note somewhere. In the above example, you could pin something like \"back in 5\" to the place you planned to meet and the recipient would understand that you didn't just not show up. Naturally, you'd use your specific recipient's phone number so everybody else isn't privy to your personal business. I'm sure there are plenty more use cases as well, but this one happened to me so often that it gave me this idea.\n\nDoes this exist already? Is it even feasible?",

In short, it's a platform that allows creativity to be paid for. The crowdfunding part would be with the 'Patrons' themselves who would initially fund education related media production for the likes of YouTube, and also be able to provide additional support for disadvantaged students concurrently. The part that I want to elaborate on is the 'good feel' (CSR related) part where anyone can help support disadvantaged students.\n\n**The Crowdfunding Element:**\n$2+ | True Larrikin!\n(you directly support disadvantaged students wanting to learn English)\n+ You directly support disadvantaged students wanting to learn English ~\n$5+ | Free English Lessons!\nReward: you will be the first to know about free English lessons 24 hours before they go live\n+ You directly support disadvantaged students wanting to learn English ~\n$25+...~\n$50+...\n\nsooo...what do you think? :)\n\nEdit: Here you go,  [My Account on Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/Larrikin) :) Thanks guys!\n\nTL;DR Rich Can Help the Poor",

Someone would write the script and then someone else would animate it and then someone to do the sound effects and someone else to do the music. I'd hope for it to be a community devoted to working together and learning about your and other people's specialties. Multiple people could submit versions of the animation or the music and hopefully instead of it being all about figuring out which one is better they'd look at both of them and study the good and bad of each. If possible, they'd then use what they'd learned and make changes accordingly.\n\nI suggest this partly because I know that it's hard to get feedback on one's work because more people want feedback than give it. I figure this sort of subreddit would a) get people to give each other good and honest feedback when they're working on a project together and b) make it more fun for other people to look at these people's work and again, if possible, give them feedback.\n\nAlso I think it would be a good way to make animated shorts.",

The idea was that a company would create realistic 360 videos for virtual reality users that would allow them to experience situations they would not be able to experience without the headsets. I got a LOT of positive feedback on the idea. One user really inspired me to make this a reality. He said \"Delete that shit... and keep it to yourself\". It made me realize how BIG of an opportunity it could be. I took the plunge and so far have launched a webpage (www.VRExperienced.com) and a subreddit /r/VRExperienced. I am now in the process of gaining a following and then buying the equipment needed to make this dream become a reality that I can share with everyone in 2016. Once again, I just wanted to say thanks to that reddit user. If you read this post, message me. \n\nIf you love virtual reality, keep an eye out for us, we are gonna be huge. ",

When you came to the business it would be very similar to a laser tag place, you would walk in, pay 7 or 8 dollars for a game. We would tell you to get in line and wait for the current game to end, when the current game ended the people who had paid for the next game would be split up into 2 teams, probably about 10 players per game, after you were split up you walk in to each teams respective armory where there would be an assortment of the foam weapons for everyone to choose from i.e. swords, shields, spears, bow and arrows and they would be provided with either a blue kickboxing helmet or a red one. Once every had selected their weapon of choice they would be read the rules by one of the referees who would be in the arena with players to prevent injuries and make sure no one broke the rules. The teams would then line up on opposite sides of the arena and either play capture the flag or last team standing or some variant for about 15 minutes. ",

I've thought of this from the lead poisoning scandal in India as a result of Nestle products, and from the current top post of /r/todayilearned in terms of formula milk and from the chocolate products they sell.\n\nA petition on restricting the freedom of panorama in the EU has been rejected, which has been a successful campaign by [change.org](https://www.change.org/p/european-parliament-save-the-freedom-of-photography-savefop-europarl-en/u/11358071), so I'm anticipating this could follow suit. There are some challenges though, to this, because it will restrict the free market of the EU, but in addition to this, Nestle has failed to provide evidence recently [of malpractices in Pakistan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nestl%C3%A9_boycott#History_of_the_boycott). In the same Wikipedia article, although various universities and colleges have banned the product, I am studying in a sixth form which has as of yet not banned them. The hospital nearby my sixth form also provides Nestle coffee and hot chocolate.\n\nEdit: I've found [this](https://euobserver.com/opinion/119907) which shows that Uzbek cotton has been banned in the EU. The author's comment in the last line should be taken into consideration, as Nestle DEPRIVES children's rights to an education and from forced labour.",

You could use it in portable, light-creating devices such as flashlights and lanterns. Children's toys which previously were very difficult to swap the batteries for would be as simple to charge as placing the toy in proximity of the charging mat/device.

(WARNING: COMPLEX CONCEPT THAT TAKES \"TIME\" TO UNDERSTAND AND TRYING TO GET SOMEONE TO UNDERSTAND IS ALMOST POSSIBLE)\nThere is only one thing that influences this. Only \"we\" at the moment know how difficult this will be and how long it could take to teach someone the concept (or that they may never understand!!). Until we see a response that verifies we both understand eachother, and that the other party is listening, the teacher is usually unaware of the amount of \"attention\" the audience is paying. This response has to be fully (comma for emphasis) FULLY \"understood\" by both parties for progress to occour.\nBut this response can be \"faked\", and the teacher can be \"tricked\" when people \"act\" like they \"understand\" because they \"Dont\" want to learn it because they \"Dont\" think its important. Understand? Good. Bare with me a moment and realize why you are following what I'm saying, and that I was actually highly aware at the moment of writing this, that \"if\" you have read this far then you \"are\" aware of the same concept as I am. The fact that we \"both\" have acknowledged the same \"understanding\" we now have a platform for \"progress\" to occour. this understanding in the \"Now\" will serve as the basis for the concept that I am currently trying to explain to you.  im going to explain a concept that I'd like to take place in the future. Bare with me a moment and realize that Currently, our language is limited by our \"own personal\" current understanding of the world. so when people do have good concepts/ideas, they tend to stand out because people tend to try to \"understand\" them. The originator or the concept is aware usually that the other party is interested in understanding which ever concept or idea that is being presented.  Now, wether that understanding can be recognized ever at 100% capacity is unknown. \"That\" is \"This\" experiment.\n\nNow, I currently believe that the internet is a place where people \"cant\" fake that understanding. Because \"why\" would they want to? Get the concept? Good, inquire below if you are interested in this \"same\" experiment and maybe we can find out.\n\n\nEDIT: IF YOU ARE HAVING TROUBLE UNDERSTANDING, THEN READ SLOWLY OUT LOUD AT A SOFT WHISPER. So you can HEAR your voice. I'm trying to help with EMPHASIS but it works BETTER if you hear it SPOKEN Slowly for some reason... This is important to the understanding of the nature of language, which is a TOOL that we have Constructed to Navigate this World. Seriously just try it, it could \"Litterally\" blow your mind. Try it only on this small little paragraph, try to pick up a metephorical message maybe, or just hear the words bounce in your head as you Understand them, something changes for me if I add voice that isn't monotone. And if this actually helps you understand what I'm talking about let me know. ",

            "selftext": "I had this thought when my family had our last road trip a few weeks ago.\n\nAside from families, there are a lot of different types of people from all walks of life who road trip: College students on break, couples on getaway, even people who are moving be it with loved ones or on their own.\n\nIn any case, at some point you might get tired of the people you're with for a bit, or even on your own. Highways are long and boring and \"I Spy\" and \"Zitch Dog\" can only be amusing for a few hundred miles, and music can only keep you entertained for so long. Unless it's 500 Miles by the Proclaimers.\n\nWhat if there was a way to get more acquainted with the other people on the road?\n\nI present to you: **Caravan**.\n\n**How it Works**\n\nCaravan works very similarly to Tinder. You register either on the website or on your mobile device through Facebook. It records your name, interests and places you've checked in. You can then either run the Caravan App or purchase a Caravan device.\n\nOnce you're ready to head out on a road trip, you input your starting location, end location, the number of passengers in your vehicle and whether you'd like to meet anyone, or only people with similar interests. And then you get in your car and drive.\n\nCaravan works with your GPS and uses your location, proximity to other cars and interests gathered through Facebook to send you information about potential friends you could make. Either party can send a message to the other, and if both parties are interested in speaking, Caravan \"links\" the cars and uses VoIP to initiate a conversation. The Links can then suggest Pit Stops to eat, rest or see sights. Either link can also disband the Caravan at any time and go on their way. \n\nCaravan will also prompt you to disband once both vehicles separate from a stretch of highway. Links can be made between any number of cars, be it 2 or 10.\n\n>For example, I am traveling from New York to Miami with my girlfriend. Once I'm in Pennsylvania, Caravan notifies me that a person from Ohio is traveling to Washington DC and is 20 miles from my location. We both share a common interest in food, and both of us have been to Alinea in Chicago.\n>\n>The other car sends a greeting and informs me of a rather interesting restaurant in the next major city. My girlfriend and I find it interesting, and accept the Link. He registers a Pit Stop and gives me the location of the restaurant. We chat while on the road, meet at the restaurant and have a meal. After our meal, we chat for a few more hours and he exits onto a new highway, and I opt to end the Link.\n\nAt your convenience, you can review the people you've Linked with, and they can review you.\n\n**Safety**\n\nYou may be thinking, \"Well, kayneargand, what if I find myself uncomfortable with the person I've linked with? What if this person is crazy and wants to murder-rape me with his Bat'leth? Well, have no fear, redditor. Caravan requires you to register your vehicle's license plate number, make and model. None of this information is divulged with other Caravaners, but is safely recorded. If you happen to Link with someone you don't quite feel safe with, you can unlink and report that person. \n\nDepending on the severity of your discomfort, you can also contact local authorities, who will then be sent information about your unsavory Link.\n\nIf, for any reason, you happen to be unfortunate enough to get a tire blowout or engine failure, Caravan can also be used as a SOS beacon. Simply tap the SOS button on the app and any passing Caravan vehicles will be alerted of your distress.\n\n**In Conclusion**\n\nI think Caravan may be an interesting way for travelers of all walks to make new friends on the otherwise mundane stretches of highway in between destinations. Aren't the miles you've traveled just as important as the place you're going?",

My idea for one of the days was to have a reverse day. This would mean that the children would come dressed up as the teachers and the teachers would come dressed up as babies. I think that my two year olds would get a real hoot out of \"Ms. Kelly drinking from a bottle and wearing a diaper.\" We could also do fun activities where the kids play mommy/daddy and \"feed us\" or \"put us to sleep.\" I thought it was a funny idea and wanted to see what the general consensus is.

I've been working a small project/app that will let me jot down my ideas as they come to me, and save them automatically, so I can come back to them later. So far, it has been pretty handy.

All issues/bills must be proposed with at least a 2,000,000 person pledge of agreement to raise it as a formal issue. From there, the proposal may be directly passed to the House of Representatives where they may be discussed and solutions be made, and/or directly to national referendum under the Populace Branch. Any proposals to be held for national referendum, will be voted on quarterly: the third Wednesday of March, June, September, and December of every year, to allow for both Legislative debate and for voters, the Populace branch, to be well informed and prepared to vote on the issues. If a vote on the issue in a national referendum is passed by a 2/3 vote by the Populace branch, the bill is taken directly to the Senate, directly past the House, where the Legislative process continues as is. \n\nThe House of Representatives may, of course, have resolved the issue and passed their own bill to the Senate after the initial Populace proposal, by which national referendum would not be necessary.\n\nTo allow for higher voter accessibility, as well as creating a more involved, more powerful voter culture in America, the voting process of the Populace branch will now include the implementation of technology, where necessary, including heavily-secure and protected internet databases where votes may be balloted, held, and quickly counted, as well as application and mobile phone support.\n\nThe goal of this Amendment is to define a succinct and clear link between voters and the democratic, legislative process. No powers of the Legislative branch, Executive branch, or Judicial branch will be infringed upon, remaining exactly as they were. However, the Populace branch, the voter population, now has a platform for introducing, discussing, proposing solutions to, and, if necessary, voting on issues not limited to the agenda of the Legislative branch, strengthening their voice.\" \n\nTl;dr: Populace Branch of government where voters can raise issues for Congress and vote on them in a national referendum.",

However I noticed some animals that didn't pass the mirror test ( like ravens ) are pretty damn smart from my limited understanding. \n\nBut that is all besides the point if bits and pieces of Terrance Mckennas \"Stoned Ape\" Theory are correct that the same type of enlightenment achieved by our primitive ancestors to spur new thoughts such as language and religion. I am not saying that theory is true but so many people claim to learn things form psychedelics and I am only interested in those naturally occurring (or could be made like ayahuasca.)\n\nSome form of psilocybin mushrooms as one part of the test just as our ancestors would have found it. ( except for test sake we grow excess amounts and give it to what ever test animals.) \n\nAyahuasca because it is still ancient in its creation and I read somewhere that the shamans say the plants taught the shamans how to make the brew. Which brings up interesting side questions. Such as If plants and humans and all life on earth evolved from a common ancestor could there not be some slight chance there is a co-social-evolutionary method for communication? Being that we have \"Learned from the plants\" could we not give that brew to other intelligent animals (yes I know humans are the ones doing the defining of intelligence) to see if we could not help speed up the process?\n\n\n1. We can study psychedelics which will be really important in the coming decades (imo) \n2. What if they do develop something that we can then start to study further. I honestly have no real idea of know what to look for in this little experiment but there is always a chance that something pretty nifty comes out of it. \n\nIf you were able to follow that good on you. And what do you think?\n\n\nEDIT: As I find links and read things I will just add them to this and maybe it could help trigger more ideas.\n\nhttps://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-playing-field/201012/animals-psychedelics-survival-the-trippiest\n\nhttp://www.nbcnews.com/id/24628983/ns/technology_and_science-science/t/smartest-animals/#.VdtE1LRNtSU",

The game might also need to know the players altitude which can be measured too. Google maps will be needed to navigate the player and track its position.

            "selftext": "I am a full time artist. I vend at art events and festivals in my local area. But I have been looking to expand to larger events however the larger events have much more expensive booth rents plus the cost of materials and prints limits how big I can go..\n\nMy solution: at a relatively small event (20k ppl) I sell about 1k of my stock card prints to a varying demographic. My art style is kinda abstract pop art...anyway.. I get all of my art supplies from one place (large corporation). My idea is to ask this large corporation to sponsor me at these larger events. \n\nI would travel and do large events with 100k+ attendees. I would do at least 15 events a year.\n\nI would offer a banner at my booth with their logo, their logo on staff shirts, as well as their promo material with each print that I sell.\n\nI did a lot of research on sponsorships and The the best idea I saw was to charge 1 cent per impression (an impression is when a person sees a logo or promo material) basically I could reasonably ask for 20k a year to sponsor me\n\nGoogle more about that in you free time.\n\nWhat I am saying is a company would be more than willing to sponsor an artist that could advertise their company IF that company and the artist have the same demographic.\n\nFor instance. If you do street style art and you wanna sell prints at an upcoming event. You may approach a local tattoo shop and ask them to pay for your booth rent in exchange for you handing out promo material with your prints.\n\nOr you could ask a bigger coporation to sponsor you for the year while you travel and sell your art.\n\nAll you have to do is make sure it is a mutually beneficial arrangement for both of you and that you both have the same target market.\n\nThis could work for any artist that does the right research and calls the right companies. Ive succeeded at this on a small scale but now I am going for the big fish!:) I recommend starting out with sending a sponsorship proposal to small local companies for local events asking for booth rent in exchange for sponsorship then working your way up to charging packages to mutiple large companies.\n\nLet me know if anyone would like a copy of the sponsorship proposals I sent my local businesses. \n\nHope this helped!:) Also lemme know if you have any ways to make this even better or tell me what you do to thrive as an artist.",

Basically an e-menu, which would let the owners/waiters change the price of anything they would want by simply changing a value of an entry.\n\nThe menu would be some sort of a tablet which would be integrated into a table \"cover\" which would fit any table it needs to be fitted on, the menu would be at the center of the table on top of a bearing which would allow it to be rotated so that everyone can read it.\n\nOf course it would be shatter-proof and resistant to spillage of liquids.\n\nThe customer would touch the screen to start, select a language, and he could browse the menu as if it was on paper, but he could tap on an item to see its content, picture and other details.\n\nThe customer then picks out a few drinks and confirms order, without the need of a waiter to come by and pick up orders.\n\nIt would have a \"Call waiter\" button, and other features such as increase font size etc., it would all be connected to a central pc at the bar which would collect orders.\n\nThis would reduce the need to call the waiter for another round and would certainly increase efficiency.\n\nAnd I just found a minor flaw, which is the power supply but I'm sure we will figure that out.\n\nAlso I feel I need to mention that I'm coming from a country in which sitting in caffes for hours is largely popular, even on work days, you could find a ton of people just sitting around in caffes.\n\nSo, any opinion would be highly appreciated. Thanks :)",

There is a lot of free environmental data provided by organizations such as the IUCN and WWF but no user friendly implementation without having to download complicated GIS software.

            "selftext": "Firstly, this is just a random idea I just got. I was kind of wishing I had a clone of myself that knew all my darkest secrets and had all my quirky ways of acting, yet was capable of having serious abstract philosophical discussions about things most people don't want to spend time wasting time on thinking/talking about. I'm sharing this here in hopes this catches the interest of someone with a bit more experience (also time and determination) than me in developing and executing ideas, so feel free to take this as your own!\n\nBackground:\nThe idea is that many of us spend a LOT of time on the internet. In a society where depression is soaring and people feel more and more alone and not understood, we seek up online global communities in search of like-minded people.\n\nThe idea:\nDue to so many of us sharing so much of our selves on the internet and sometimes doing so anonymously, we kind of have mapped a lot of who we are. The service would be granted access to our browsing history and would be tracking everything we do by the computer and then using this to match people up with others who have very similar activities on the net!\n\nOf course, this would be extremely dangerous in the wrong hands, so a service like this would have to guarantee that all information is somehow unreadable for anything else than the matching algorithm.\n\nWhat do you think? I know that millions would use this service if it existed and was fully functional AND it gave a somewhat feasible guarantee that ones information was safe. If you like the idea and actually try developing it, I'd be grateful if you just let me know about it \\^_^ \n\nAlso, other than online dating, does this maybe already exist and I just didn't know about it?",

Register with voter ID and observe, comment on, and vote on current issues.\n\nIssues where a representative portion of the population (scaled based on population of area i.e. county, state, federal, etc.) disagree with a federal decision would immediately cede power to the people in the form of a veto, nullifying any work.  People could also create their own bills/ideas/etc. and locate a political sponsor to assist them in drafting legislation.\n\nDifferent local/federal issues could show as \"trending\" if they have enough traffic and literally any government decision could be made by the population (obviously the government should be given an opportunity to revise/vote back a bill if contested) even up to an act of war.\n\nThink Twitter, imagine if President Obama were to post on this site \"In 1 hour I have to give a response to a recent terrorist attack, which may result in a war.  During the next 1 hour I urge the American public to vote on whether or not we should declare war against [foreign power] and will follow through with a representative vote.  If a representative number is not reached, there would still be a lot of pressure on gov't officials to side with a large portion of the population for their own vote.\n\nBasically just a giant \"fuck no\" button to stupid legislation or issues that have taken way too long to resolve.  We have the technology to break our current system, which takes weeks/months/years to resolve even the simplest of issues, and create instantaneous public feedback and decision making, given the right technology.\n\nThoughts?",

Every day the scanner scoops Craigslist items up and finds close or exact matches in eBay as \"completed items.\" It finds the price difference and emails or texts you with an Arbitrage Alert. You can then call the Craigslist buyer and purchase the item, then turnaround and sell it immediately on eBay at or near the current going rate and profit. \n\nExample: Someone is selling a pair of RayBans for $20. The scanner compares the item on Craigslist with recent completed RayBan glasses sales. If the price difference is sufficient (maybe $20-$40 for your time and trouble) the price scanner emails you an alert or text. \n\nAs a bonus, I would love to see the price scooper take and automatically email or text the Craigslist buyer to hopefully secure the local item sooner than anyone else.\n\n",
