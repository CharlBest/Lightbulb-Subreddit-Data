We seriously have to find a solution to the AdBlock problem. \n\nThis is a very simplified example and I do see the flaws, the biggest one being that you might not want to donate the same amount of money for inadvertatly reading 10 minutes of buzzfeed crap and verdantly reading 10 minutes of [this](https://youtu.be/Mh5LY4Mz15o) or maybe you don't want to give loads to the Twitch streamer you watched for 6 hours. But I'm sure these flaws can easily be fixed for example by setting a multiplier to what is generally known as \"good\" content (good youtube channels, respected editorial websites) or putting a multiplier on videos that have been liked wether set by default or not. And of course at the end of the month before donating the money it tells you how much it recommends you give to each content creator with the option to give more to people you think deserve it more (you like them more, you think they deserve more because of extra effort in content) with simply sliders...\n\nWould people use such a thing? How could this work? \n\nPlenty of content creators would get on board and promote this if done well.\n\nThoughts?",

That would be pretty interesting don't you think?  And lets not forget the thousands of news topics that get posted every day that are not covered by the top news stations. They can even have their own Funny video show from all the user submissions on r/funny and other similar subreddits. How about the after hours NSFW show? (That may be pushing it)..Anyway,  I think it would be a relatively easy task for a production company... The material is there.. All they need is airtime and some hosts.

            "selftext": "What if the government would pay you to make YouTube videos? I've had this idea for a while now. I've thought it through and I'm going to layout some details of how this will be achieved. \n\nInitially, everybody is paid a minimum wage of 7 dollars an hour. It is assumed that you work for 10 hours a day. In order to receive your paycheck, you must create 5 videos a week. And these videos must be substantive in length and in content - no b.s. 1 second videos. Each video must be at least 4 minutes long to qualify. \n\nThis system would also promote capitalism. The more views and subscribers that you can attain, the more you can get paid. In this regard, you are incentivized to work harder for a larger capital gain. \n\nYou must be at least 16 to sign up. This system is versatile because really anybody can work this job. Teens, adults, seniors and everybody in-between. It can be utilized as a summer job, part-time job, or even a full-time job. \n\nYouTube videos are relatively easy and quick to make. It isn't rocket science. The most popular YouTubers are generally unskilled and untalented. YouTube is very marketable. More content will be created.\n\nUltimately, this would mobilize the unemployed to work this simple job of just making videos either until they can get footing or as a full-time job.  \n\n\nWhat are your reactions to my idea? Do you think it could work? Send me some feedback. Let me know! ",

You hold the bottle sideways, like a boob, so that the infant doesn't choke on the milk.\n\nBack in the day, the old design made sense. Glass is harder to work with, and you just make more formula than you need. Nowadays, most bottles are plastic and many babies are fed precious, precious pumped breastmilk. \n\nSo a bottle with an offset nipple would help with that last bit. While we're at it, bottles could unscrew in the middle, into two halves, not at the nipple. That would give them a tighter seal and be easier to wash.",

So I started tinkering my own vision of a better and more engaging interface: A world dark and set in the future, where planet Earth is under constant wave of meteors; human civilization has moved backwards and survives on farming and windmills for energy. The to-do items take the form of meteors falling from the sky. The best part is when a task is completed the meteor explodes into a giant ball of fireworks. A serious \"bad ass\" way to say task complete. On the other hand, if a deadline is missed, the meteor comes crashing with smoke and red flames everywhere.\nHere is what I created. www.crimsonbox.net or https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/crimson-box/id1069271059",

Answer:  Is anybody going to give a damn?  Don't we already have fresh water there enough to support the existing population in those states? \n\nI say that that's not really what I'm talking about.  I'm talking about the U.S. rethinking the future of its Southwest aside from California for the next 100 years.  \n\nThe Southwest U.S. is wonderful, a place where everybody in the U.S. SHOULD live and work.  Why should our people punish themselves living and working in Minnesota or South Dakota or Arkansas when Arizona is spectacular outside for three seasons of the year and there's max AC to cover the fourth? And apply that to Utah, New Mexico, and Nevada, also.  Add water and it's a veritable Garden of Eden, everywhere there, frankly.\n\nLet me constrain my proposal a bit, though:  Lets do a trial run -- say, the environmental modification (using desalinated Pacfic Ocean water) of one large, undeveloped, newly-selected desert-section of say, Arizona or Nevada.  Let said \"section\" become a new, Rhode Island-sized oasis -- a test case.  If it \"clicks\" -- people love it and move to it -- then we take it further. \n\nOk, you could argue:  \"Oh, well, dude, there's already a ton of developed areas in the Southwest states you mentioned.  They're using water piped-in from the Colorado river or elsewhere, but the principle is the same -- the water is just from an inland source.  And it's cheaper to boot.\"  \n\nI'd say, you're right.  But I'd also insist that if companies from other states saw such a new, beautiful, affordable developed-oasis to work at, they would pull-up stakes from other states I mentioned and do business there.  The money would move there, the jobs would move there, the people would move there.  \n\nBut they need to want to be there.  Give them something better than what they have at a price they can afford.  Desalinate Pacific Ocean water and pipe it to create new desert oases that draw businesses and people to Arizona, Nevada, Utah and New Mexico.\n\nEdit:  And I'd add that the solar power potential in those 4 states is absurdly good, ludicrous.

I\u2019ve been working on an idea of mine which I thought of several years ago, but only began developing this year. I\u2019ve named it \u201cShop Pal\u201d - the go-to app for managing your household and grocery needs. Shop Pal is great for families who want to avoid all the stresses of grocery shopping. It\u2019s currently a prototype (but will eventually support all major platforms), and I would appreciate if you could let me know what you think of it, so I can get good validation and feedback for improvement.\n\nHave you ever experienced any of the following? (To name a few)\n\n- Forgetting to buy the one product you went out to get\n- Waking up and realizing you\u2019re all out of toothpaste\n- Getting stuck in traffic on your way to the grocery store\n- Waiting in long grocery store checkout lines\n- Carrying heavy shopping bags to and from your vehicles\n\nThis app aims to reinvent and innovate the shopping process, by taking it online at the touch of a button. The idea is currently in development, however, the app is intended to be seamless and easy to use.\n\nShop Pal, is literally, your Shopping Pal. It begins to learn your family\u2019s shopping habits to ensure that you always have what you need when you need it.\n\nShop Pal\u2019s features include:\n\n\n- Household inventory and shopping list management system\n- Family member food request function\n- Notification system that alerts you to events such as products low in stock, pending food requests and more\n- Homemade recipe database\n- Automated order and delivery of food ingredients\n- Dinner detector that notifies you which dinners you can make when items in your inventory match the ingredients of your saved recipes\n- Network sharing to engage with local community and earn Shop Pal loyalty Bucks\n- Local sales sorted by product and location, also based on frequent purchases\n- Analytics that track shopping habits including dollar spent, minutes saved using the app etc.\n\nFeatures that we will potentially implement:\n\n- The ability to scan a barcode from a receipt to add items to inventory\n- Image recognition so you can snap a picture of your food to add or remove from inventory\n- Smart learning so the app helps keep track of your inventory by asking you intelligent questions based on past history\n- A fun and enjoyable game featuring Pal, the dog from our logo, that\u2019s purpose is to also help you keep track of your inventory by representing inventory tracking questions as elements of the game. This feature motivates users to earn more Shop Pal Bucks by getting higher scores\n- An accessory device for barcode scanning that makes it easy to scan items to add or remove products from inventory\n\nIf some or all of this description was interesting to you, please view our demo video in the link below to see Shop Pal in action!\n\nDemo video youtube ID is TRe377u28SY\n",

            "selftext": "The idea is kind of a cross between StackOverflow and ResearchGate.  Probably best explained by an example:\n\nI posted an idea on this subreddit about a week ago with an \"out there\" proposal to use bacteria to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, produce and combust hydrogen to create heat for energy, and then capture the pure water.\n\nI don't have nearly enough expertise in anything to pull it off, but I can think of several \"sub-ideas\", questions, and steps involved.\n\nFor example,\n\n1. Where can I find the carbon fixation rates of different bacterial species?\n1. What are the hydrogen production rates for different bacteria.  \n1. Shining light at a particular frequency can increase hydrogen yield dramatically, so what if you used solar-powered LED's at that frequency?  Would the loss from the photovoltaic conversion be outweighed by the increase in hydrogen productivity (I think it would, but I don't know!)\n1. Are there any existing steam turbines that use hydrogen?\n1. Who builds them?  Do they do contract work?  \n\netc...\n\nIt's like StackOverflow with three major differences:\n\n1. Questions and answers are all geared toward a particular project, and the forum would have tools to organize, curate, and moderate discussion and information *toward the particular goal of the overarching thread/project idea*.\n1. Users on the site can use it as a simple social network, and can put out \"tagged-requests\" for questions requiring certain skill-sets.  For instance, say your expertise is \"photovoltaic-powered LED's\" -- if I posted question 3 from the above list, you might be notified.  Or alternatively, I might be able to seek  you out based on your profile.\n1. Perhaps most importantly, in addition to the typical reputation  on online forums, there would be some kind of ownership of a particular project thread based on the number of up-votes you have in the thread relative to the total up-votes.  That way, if a project takes off in academia as a publication or in business as a profitable product, you maintain that amount of ownership over the result.  Obviously, this one will need some cleverness to prevent up-vote spamming (people or bots) and to prevent random lurkers from stealing the collaborative effort from the community.\n\nBut overall, I think it might have a shot of working.\n\n I have experience with web development, so I'd love to try to integrate everyone's ideas into a prototype/proof-of-concept if there's feedback or suggestions.\n",

            "selftext": "I got this idea from watching [this video](https://youtu.be/YZUNRmwoijw), in which a guy uses a computer simulation to 'evolve' wind turbine blade designs into being more efficient than a human designed blade. In the video, the simulation evolves a very unconventional wind turbine blade that arguably could have never been designed deliberately by a person, yet (within the simulation) is more efficient than the best-designed blades out there. I've messed with various evolution simulators before. They are a mild obsession of mine. But seeing one used to produce something practical like this got me thinking.\n\nWith enough computing power, you could potentially create an evolution-based simulator to design just about anything, from cars to chairs to computer processors. It would take a lot of power, but with computing power ever on the increase, I don't see this as being a big problem. You would need software that could perform the functions of CAD software, plus the functions of simulation software, plus generating random parameters within a given design template. It would then go through some process to determine the best designs, mix and match (mate) them, and run the simulation over and over until something innovative pops out. This is basically how evolution works, and applying it to engineering and product design could yield results we literally can't imagine.\n\nThere is no way I myself could implement this idea. I lack the funds, the know-how, the time, or really anything other than the initial idea. But, the potential benefit to everyone is great enough that I wanted to get it out there anyways. If anyone has the means and motive, feel free to take it and run with it.",

It can be created in a way that the feet are the only part of the body that you actually feel pressure from, the rest of the suit is just to keep you from falling over.

It has become a way of live for the internet folks. YouTube wouldn't be same without trolls trying to get attention, trying to be offensive or trying to start long comment wars. People wouldn't get chance to exhibit, refurbish and learn new arguing and counter arguing abilities.  \n\nTrolls invest huge portions of their time trolling. They are hard at work finding better profile pictures with better fedora and neck beards, making new accounts time and again on different social media platforms and boards. They spend huge amounts of time researching new ways of being offensive, better commenting techniques and better ways of getting attention. \n\nAs foul as they might be, we need to understand what they are and how they behave as they have become an interesting feature of the internet community. We must study them and preserve the studies for future generations. We must devise a classification and nomenclature system for trolls. As far as I understand there are several types/species of trolls on the internet. \n\n>https://darkpsychology.co/troll/ \n\n\nThis site already lists a few types of trolls but I think we can come up with more types and sub types as well.

This is the perfect solution! \n\nA single 0.20\u20ac coin, for example, weights 5.74g. This means if you keep all your money in the form of 20 cent coins, every 1000\u20ac will weight 28.7 kg, and take up a large amount of space too. There's no way anyone would steal that when they need a large van just to take a mediocre amount of money. \n\nYou can of course adjust the weight and size to any level you want by using different coin denominations and a bit of math. \n\nCentral banks are generally obligated to exchange coins to bills for free if you ask them, so for exchanging small amounts of money you'd just need your car trunk and a few minutes of driving.

In the case of shows like Futurama and Bob's Burgers, the intro sequence is different every episode, so it's a unique piece  of the show.

            "selftext": "Standard Time \u21d4 Daylight Saving Time switching during Fall Back and Spring Forward disrupts our sleep cycle and thus adversely affects our well-being. This is the motivation for schools and businesses to opt-out of the biannual time switching. By voluntarily using standard time or daylight saving time throughout the year. \nNew time notations for general use could look like the following:\n\n* 7:11 AM V - Short for variable. This is a new, explicit way to denote  7:11 AM standard time in the winter, 7:11 AM daylight saving time in the summer\n* 7:11 AM S - Short for standard. Denotes  7:11 AM standard time in the winter, 8:11 AM daylight saving time in the summer\n* 7:11 AM D - Short for daylight saving. Denotes  6:11 AM standard time in the winter, 7:11 AM daylight saving time in the summer\n\nAnd for 24-hour notation, the AM/PM is not necessary so it's simpler. If the V/S/D is omitted in writing, one has to assume from context what it means.\n\nIn the US, one practice that might become popular would be for Central time to go daylight throughout the year, and Eastern to go Standard throughout, so not only do you have no timeshifting throughout the year, you'd also get the same time throughout two zones. This would be better for scheduling, health, energy, productivity, and enjoyment of life.\n\nSince this is opt-in on a per-organization basis, there should be no bureaucratic cost involved to make this change. The government won't make the change for us, we'll just do it ourselves.",

These would be very small states only consisting of tens of thousands of people, that came here by choice, which means they most likely adhere to that political system. They would exist for a couple of decades going to half a century. The UN would give these states \"Temporary independance\" after which they would continue belonging to the original state they were in before. ",

            "selftext": "Hi guys. A few months ago I made my spare room into a home office. I bought a new, quite expensive desk that was a bi*ch to fit into my tiny room. Then, after a few weeks I decided I want a standing desk :)\n\nI own a small web store so I have a lot of cardboard boxes laying around. I took a few boxes and some tape and made my first prototype of what would become Switch Stance - Foldable, portable and cheap stand, that transforms any desk into sit/stand desk.\n\nI made some samples on cardboard plotter, experimented with different types of cardboard (learned that there are some really tough types out there) and here it is.\n\nThe project is live on Kickstarter, if you want to take a look.\n\nI know there are similar products on the market, but none than I've seen folds down to this level or be used in different positions like Switch Stance.\n\nI know there are some downsides to this, but I use it every day and it works for me. It looks like there are some other people who think this is a cool idea :)\n\nLink to Kickstarter project: http://kck.st/1RH9ecU",

There would obviously be others, I just don't know what everybody would want.

Someone could do some research on each person and see how they thought(As in scattered ideas, or methodical, controlled, racing thoughts, etc.) and model it based on that, although that's not necessary.\n\nNow a voice actor starts speaking, someone who sounds like or has the same accent as Einstein, not pinpoint, but just close enough to get the experience. The material can come from stuff that he wrote during his life, inventions he made, etc. So for example something like:\n>I wonder if I could mathematically calculate energy? Let's start with what it relates to. Oh I remember now from that book I read, it talked about the coorelation between _. Ah yes, but even if _ is related how does that explain _? I wonder if there is in fact an equation, it could possibly explain where _ comes from in the universe?\n\nAnd the black screen would display white text syncing up with what the voice actor is saying, and possibly visuals(diagrams, etc.) to simulate being \"inside someone's mind\".\n\nSomething like that.\n\nObviously it wouldn't be precise, but someone could definitely make a pretty good simulation if they wanted to.

And the beauty is .. if there is any technical problems at all, the plane just keeps going and launches off the other end.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/rXbfOsx.jpg\n\nBonus:  The runway surface is a grid, allowing airflow. There are some jet engines mounted on the roof of the skyscraper that blow from the right to the left, creating an artificial headwind, reducing the required speed of the ~~airplane~~  jet (sorry, only jet people have meetings in skyscrapers).\n",

            "selftext": "Imagine trading video game profits like people trade company stocks. A lot more good quality games and lower risk studios would be able to create more for the masses. Not only do you give money to make the video game happen from scratch like in kickstarter, but you get to profit and make a living off of supporting and picking good video games. Lets call it \nICO. Initial Crowd Offering, like IPOs but for projects such as video games and movies instead of entire companies\n\n\nBasically i will be looking to combine crowdfunding and trading with marketing. Something mobile and simple like tinder where you swipe left for games that interest you and swipe right for games that do not. And then when you've filtered down the ones that interest you or not you get to see whats the news, new trailers, new announcements all in one. and from there you decide whether to buy percentage of the video games profit in advance, before it is released. If its a massive success you get a share in their profits, based on how many percent you bought.\n\nNow which video game studio would like to share the burden and costs of the budget? Most of them, and you split the risk enough with crowdfunding. Not only do you give money to make the video game happen from scratch like in kickstarter, but you get to profit and make a living off of supporting and picking good video games. \n\nNow i'm looking for people to work this idea with and we need all types, i already have people doing the part on the ecommerce and the transfer security, now i need coders for the trading programs so we can make this a new market for trading.\n\nThis sounds really crazy right now but so was the airplane not so long ago. Lets make a living off creating and trading masterpieces we enjoy. I need people who sees this as a good idea and willing to help make it happen\n\n\n\nREDESIGN YOUR THINKING FOR VIDEO GAMES AND MOVIES\nI am trying to create a trading platform with movies as the first step to bringing together an idea. I want to create a functional usable testable prototype. My project name is ICO (initial crowd offering) World of Movies. It's sort of like crowdfunding, but as an investment, it would be really neat to be able to invest in something that i am as passionate about, and at the same time fueling the art scene, where many people need the money to create something beautiful, one of a kind and not mainstream enough for the producers, producers that stand in the way of the directors.\n\nSome things that are obstacles that are also unknowns in my project, firstly i don\u2019t know if i have the patience to sort through the bureaucratic homerun that is hollywood nor the paperwork and legal stuff from a movie funding agreement. Why? because i glaze over when i look at legal terms and fine print. Next around is i don\u2019t know if i can find believers, people who genuinely believe that taking out the middleman from the movie industry is something they would pay for. It seems that because the idea would be too radical, but i try to explain to them, kickstarter people are taking money for free to make new movies, why is that such a huge step to take? I don\u2019t know if i have the technical expertise to fuse together both technology and value trading. I\u2019m just a guy with an idea trying to make the lowest lo fi prototype so that i can find like minded people and i intend to do so.\n\nI took the experimental approach, the reason was that i wanted to come up with prototypes to test so that people would understand the concept. Some ideation was needed to come up with a prototype and i couldn\u2019t find a better way than to wireframe an app that was a game. I modeled this closely after the app trader hero as i really liked the GUI and it was a most interesting concept that blended video games, gamification and stock trading. Other ideas i thought about was to have a contest for finding out what the best movies will be. Or maybe a board game using monopoly money instead of real money. This ultimately fell through when i had to pick the most unexpected and plan for it. An unexpected idea was that i would be able to pick the movies not using a tiny phone app but that i would be able to trade seamlessly with a projection screen (like a cinema watching movies), blending entertainment and investing. Some props i would use is different cardboards held by different people showing different menu options/movies that can be picked. Roles would be holding the cardboard and coming ahead or in front/ in and out of frame when \u2018swiped away\u2019\n\nShortly after testing the prototype i found that having everything in one page would be the best way to go for it, as clean as i want the interface to be, more information per page without swiping would work with people better. Also it would be better to appeal to the movie lovers than investors, to sort the movies based on genre\u2019s, actors, cast, partners, trailers, than budget, release date, revenue\u2026 Makes sense i suppose it is for movie creators after all. \n\nI have spoken about this concept to many friends and people who like movies and with this prototypes i can get them to understand better what do i exactly have in mind. I am almost done with phase 1 of the prototypes and it's clearer than ever that this will be doable. I learned that people will listen to your ideas once you show commitment that you have an execution ready instead of just an idea. For now i do not have an app yet, but i do have a good wireframe in powerpoint form where i can show page by page what the user experience is like. I will be showing this to some startup friends that would give me some more insight into the plan for monetizing it. For now other than the app, a good way to make this more viable would be to start off with contests to raise awareness amongst the movie maker community. With that in mind i will continue refining my concept and iterate it as it goes, I am that much closer to realizing my radical dreams thanks to design thinking. \n\nIts like https://www.fig.co/ but with more profit sharing and trading in and out\n\nI need people to work with me on this, developers, directors, finance people, investing people, and most importantly crowdfunders. \n\n\nMore information below as i explain the idea further, check it out and drop me a line please :)\nhttps://docs.google.com/presentation/d/19Q6Ku2OGp02MoRefB5z-ssirOgFKp8Paiq8Y9JeZIQc/edit?usp=sharing\n\n\n\ntldr: HELP MAKE MORE OF THE ART YOU LOVE BY CROWDFUNDING IT AND PROFIT FROM YOUR INVESTMENTS BY TRADING IT LIKE STOCKS OR BUY AND HOLD THE PROFITS FROM THE PRODUCT",

            "selftext": "First time reading stuff on this subreddit so I'm not sure if my idea would be good enough, but to me it was a lightbulb moment.\n\nFirstly; when drinking a hot chocolate drink that mom got me from McDonalds, I peeled the sticker off the cup and put it on the card that will get me a free drink if I collect 6 stickers on it. I  haven't been swimming for a while so I thought I'll create a routine of going swimming in the morning and then pop into McDonalds for a breakfast and a hot chocolate to create a routine.\n\nSecondly; My idea morphed when I thought about this homeless man who's a really great mate of my mom's and she sometimes gives him dog food for his pet dog and a bun from the bakery. Once I collect 6 stickers on my card, I'll ask her to give it to the man so that he can get himself a hot drink from McDonalds for free. Plus, it's only valid until the 31st of December 2016, so he can use it anytime.\n\nThirdly; And then my idea changed AGAIN and I realise that not everyone collects the stickers off the McDonalds drink cups. What if McDonalds starts a scheme where they have a separate rubbish bin exclusively for used drinking cups, and then they have someone look for stickers left behind and recycle them by putting them on cards and distributing them to Food Banks, so that people will have free hot drinks?\n\nI don't think McDonalds would actually do that though. Maybe it'll take too much time and there'll always be a snobby Health and Safety Executive saying that there'll be a risk of staff burning themselves on contents left behind in the hot drink cups. But now that I thought of the idea it would seriously help the homeless and shed some good light on the McDonalds company.",

            "selftext": "Macdonalds was so successful because in all of its restaurants across the country, [you get the same exact hamburger](http://www.conservapedia.com/Hamburger#Standardized_fast_food).  \n  \n> the McDonalds hamburger has meat that weighs 1.6 ounces (45 grams) and measures 3 and 5/8 inches (9.2cm) across; and is garnished with a quarter of an ounce of chopped onion, a teaspoon of mustard, a tablespoon of ketchup and a pickle slice one inch in diameter.  \n  \nPeople put a lot of value on this kind of reliability.  \n  \nIt occurred to me the other night that a different product might also be well-served by standardization of this kind: roommates.  \n  \nIt seems kind of hit and miss with roommates. It seems like with every new roommate you have to establish standards for how rent will be paid, whether to share expenses on consumables (like detergent and paper towels), how the chores will be divided, girlfriend visits, and all kinds of other trivial variations like these.  \n  \nSo what if there were some kind of \"franchise\" for roommates? Where if you had a sublease you had to fill, you could rely on the users of this franchise to abide by certain pre-established conventions. This way, you'd save time vetting people from craigslist or wherever, because you'd have some degree of certainty that this roommate, like Macdonalds burgers, will be reliable from one place to another.  In theory, you could fill your vacancy with an individual from Beijing, or Buenos Aires and get the exact same quality.\n  \nI suppose the \"franchise\" (I'm looking for a better word. It sounds so corporate) would be an online community of similar people that would collectively decide what behaviors and attitudes would be standardized.  \n  \nI know people are not hamburgers. It's just an analogy :)",

            "selftext": "TL;DR- This may already exist somewhere, if so, please let me know, I'd love to learn more about it. Basically, what I'm picturing is a hybrid of AMAs and presidential debates/political summits, where two prominent figures representing two opposing sides come together in one spot to debate each other. \n\nThe recent flare-up in gamergate related stuff got me thinking about this. Both sides of the debate (or all, if there are more than just the two sides) have different subreddits, forums, online communities, etc, and both sides have members/affiliates who claim to be interested in logic/truth/facts etc. I was thinking it'd be interesting if somehow you could get both sides to nominate a representative of their community to have a respectful online debate with the other side's representative. \n\nYou could have both participants mutually agree on a neutral third party moderator to direct and/or regulate the discussion, crowdsource questions and topics, have pre-established rules for the participants that both sides would agree to respect beforehand (and be allowed to propose any relevant additions to the debate guidelines for their specific debate, provided both parties agree beforehand). \n\nThe reason I said 'internet' issues (apart from it being because I came up with the idea while reading about gamergate) is because, for one, the regular news seems to handle more 'real world' issues well enough on its own (for the most part). \n\nMore interestingly though, is the fact that the internet tends to fragment into communities of like-minded individuals, which are then prone to developing skewed views of the opposition and of the validity of their own points. I think a site/subreddit/community/whatever like this could be really interesting in bridging the gaps between more isolated online circles in constructive and potentially illuminating ways. ",

Say, I know only english and have never been to germany but I'm trying to learn german. The VR app starts up, you wake up in the bed and subtitles appear on the screen that you're supposed to say. Then maybe your wife wakes up beside you and you're supposed to say your dialogues that appear on the screen. You go to work, but stop at a coffee shop before continuing. Basically there'll be a bunch of opportunities to talk. Then maybe you have to present a report that you already have prepared earlier. This would be like reciting an essay or something in a realistic environment. Then you have to go to a party or something. Pretty much a 'german/italian/whatever life simulator' if you will.\n\nI would totally buy this.\n\nOn the technical side, I think something like those little wireless motion tracking dots could be stuck on a native speakers lips and they could be made to do the voiceovers for the 'game'. So that not only do we get the proper native way of speaking in that language but also how their mouth moves.\n\nTo judge how well the users are doing, it could have a machine learning algorithm. Like take a bunch of speeches or maybe even audio from german tv shows (for example), transcribe them and the algorithm can then learn to identify who's saying what and how accurately. (This is just basic audio-based natural language processing. Like Google now)",

Here's the [video](\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaOnrIRf_Mg)\n\nIt's a pretty cool idea and looks like it would be much cheaper than a comparative mag lev train system, but I think it can be improved. And as a complete idiot non-engineer, I am sure that my improvements would be [amazing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect)!\n\nFirstly, I'm looking at the power source. It appears as though they are planning to use an onboard power generation system. This is a negative simply because it increases the costs and weight involved in the individual aircraft. I would change to an integrated power transmission system in the track. Using a system designed for [highways](http://news.stanford.edu/news/2012/february/wireless-vehicle-charge-020112.html), it would work even better for a ground effect craft as it would operate at the most efficient speed for power transmission. The transmitter side can also be spread out a little further to generate a larger power effect over the area of the wings which would contain the power \"receiver\". The integration of the power supply into the track allows for a greater variety of power production methods. Anything from track mounted PVs to a remote nuclear power station which would lower the carbon and pollution footprint of this high speed rail.\n\nNow with the electric power being sent on board, you might think that i will use electric motors to provide propulsion. And you would be wrong!\n\nYes, my great and mighty [brain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissism) has decided that the propulsion side needs a different tech: [Rim Drive Propellers](https://youtu.be/Te_xejpriFM)! Currently in use on marine vessels, there has been research into using them on aircraft because of their increased efficiency and lowered [disk loading effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_loading) for it's size. Current models are powered by electric motors, which makes sense since the weight is not as much of an issue for an already heavy marine craft. But this is an aircraft, why go with something so heavy?\n\n\nI won't.\n\nMy plan is to integrate much lighter [air bearings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOTWx69mghM) into the ducting and then provide power to the propeller disk by compressed air motors. This system is much lighter than using an electromagnetic rim drive which lowers the gyroscopic forces on the propulsion assembly. In addition, the compressed air becomes a self cooling system which can also be used for environmental controls inside the cabin. The compressor would be mounted in the center of the craft to increase stability while using a [Rotary-screw compressor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotary-screw_compressor) for reduced noise and minimizing the storage system requirements.\n\n\nAnd now I get really out of my depth by altering the shape of the wing assembly. Instead of the horizontal and vertical airfoils, I would use something similar to the [Beechcraft V-tail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V-tail), but for the main wing, Although this tail was first sold as a way to reduce the wetted surface, it ended up being equal. Which for my design means that I have a larger area to collect the electricity produced by the \"railway\", this will ensure the system is as efficient as possible in power transfer. This wing shape also creates an easier track construction and provides a smoother flight, as shown by some of these [videos](https://youtu.be/jZuJMbn9LVI) by one of the designers.\n\nFinally, I would create the train stations to use a compressed air surface for slow speed maneuvering of the craft while they come to a complete stop. By using a single wheel in the stern and a compressed air system similar to an air hockey table for the wings, you can ensure that the craft can be stopped at a specific loading point. Then no harm would come to the craft while it sits at the station for loading and unloading. In addition the power requirements would be less than is used by mag-lev trains that require power to \"hover\".  This would also allow for a shorter take off distance as the craft will already be \"airborne\" when the thrusters are switched on.\n\nThis ground effect would be an excellent idea for high speed \"rail\" in the US. Cheap construction to cover the larger distances involved while still being cleaner and faster than our current systems.",

It'd be great to be able to show appreciation for them with something that fits in your pocket. Hence this idea!\n\nThe case itself would be made from a thin cardboard that is thick enough to be durable and thin enough to be printed on and stick in your pocket. You choose the book, we print it on the case. The case would be a standard size such that \"most\" phones would be able to fit. This would be done by attaching a simple plastic phone case to the inside based on whichever phone you have. Inside the wallet would be room for cards, money, coins, pen/stylus, and a phone charger. Just an idea atm. Working on a prototype. \n\nThoughts?",

It sounds ridiculous in 2016 that a problem from the 1980s still haunts us, but hey, life is stranger than fiction.\n\nIt would also appear that the government is unwilling to solve the problem once and for all, with funding dedicated to putting a band-aid on the problem being consistently slashed as pointed out in the segment. Why? I speculate that it's because not enough \"important\" people (i.e., campaign contributors, able to vote, etc.) have problems with lead.\n\nSo why don't we have crowdfunding campaigns to solve this problem and other similar problems?\n\nThe segment cites a study that says it will cost $16.6 billion to permanently remove all lead from all housing in the entire country.\n\nWhy not have a giant crowdfunding campaign to collect said $16.6 billion, and then donating it to whichever government agency that does the work, earmarked for lead removal work and lead removal alone?\n\nOn average, that will cost each citizen $51, which is a reasonable amount if you consider that some people will give far larger amounts to offset those who can't afford it.\n\nWhy aren't we funding this?\n\nIt's not like it'll be the first time citizens have paid the government.

            "selftext": "**Introduction**\n\nIn the near future, machine is going to be more efficient that it will replace most manual operation which is being done by human today. Most fear of that day as it will displace human and leave many unemployed. You might argue that human can build on these automated services and can always create a new kind of job. Reality is, the advancement of technology is simply too fast as compare to our ability to adopt. One of the many example is Uber where taxi drivers is protesting because of the efficiency in Uber algorithm to match driver and passenger which caused a sharp drop in taxi driver income.\n\nBefore you realize, technology will disrupt your industry (be it engineering, medical, or other) and the next thing you know, you\u2019ll be the one standing in the middle of the road protesting to the advancement of the technology.\n\nIs the basic income the best that we can come up with?\n\nWe can do better.\n\n**Universal Databank**\n\nI propose a universal databank. Below is the general application flow of how user, application, and databank interact with each other.\n\n    User <- use -> Application <- query -> Databank (Server)\n\n* User can use the application just like how you are using now or the application can be setup to perform autonomous stuff on behalf of the user.\n* Application can be in the form of software or hardware. Application is created by third party developer.\n* Databank functions just like a normal database. Every piece of data in the databank have three privacy policy namely; public, private and priced. Data owner can set the policy for each new data created. Application can perform the usual CRUD operation. Each of this operation is sandboxed to the data the application has access to. Application by default has access to public data and user data (private data owned by the current user session). In order for the application to access the priced policy data, the application can buy the data from the databank.\n\nThe transaction from the priced data is then split between the data owner, developer (which create the application responsible to create the data in the first place), and the databank.\n\nData owner should get the largest split from the transaction, followed by developer and lastly the databank. Example split ratio should be data owner (50%), developer (30%), databank (20%).\n\nThe databank should be run as non-loss, non-dividend company (social business) where it is financially self-sustainable and profits realized by the business are reinvested in the business itself with the aim of increasing social impact.\n\n**A World with Universal Databank**\n\nWe can use mobile application just as we are doing now with the exception that everything we did will generate income for us. In the near future where the light switch is connected to the databank, an act of turning on/off the switch will also generate income for us. Further down into the future where sensors are everywhere, the simple act of going into the room will trigger the sensor and create data for us and it will generate income for us. By then, we are free to pursue our dream or even work on social causes without worry about income.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIn order to make this happens, we need to get the right people involved. This idea is by no mean perfect, there are many other things to be worked out. \n\nIf you find this idea to be outrageous, leave a comment, I\u2019ll be glad to listen.\n\nIf you have any questions on this idea, leave a comment, I\u2019ll be glad to answer. \n\nIf you find it interesting, share this post.\n\nIf you are social investor interested in this idea, do PM me.\n\nI believe the more people involve, the bigger the impact, the higher the chances of this happening. \n",

Instead, you call my company, which will immediately dispatch a doctor and a paramedic in an ambulance to wherever you are to diagnose whatever ails you and treat you there. \n\nThe doctor would be able to treat minor injuries and illnesses, and the ambulance would be stocked will a mini-pharmacy of essential medications so that the doctor can not only diagnose what's wrong with you but he or she can also treat you then and there. The types of injuries that my medical professionals would treat would include things like broken bones, cuts requiring stitches, high fevers, animal bites and other like conditions that need more care than what a non-medical professional would be able to provide. \n\nIf more intensive medical care is required, the doctor and paramedic will take you to the nearest hospital - or one of your choosing, and the doctor will accompany you in and let the emergency room physicians know what your ailments are. My company would operate twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. \n\nAn important part of the service we would provide is a triage service. Let's say you're having chest pain. When you call my company, the doctor would check your vitals when he or she arrived and would discern if you needed further treatment. They would stay and monitor you to see if you would need immediate transport to the hospital or if you would be alright without it. \n\nThis service would cost about as much as an E.R. visit, and we would accept insurance. I'd call the company MobiTriage\u00ae. I think that my company could help people - both those who are injured and don't wish to wait in long E.R. lines and those who feel ill and think that they should go to the hospital but aren't sure and would like the opinion of a doctor without having to make an appointment and wait for an actual doctor's office visit.

            "selftext": "Newer cars (2012-2014) were pretty much the pioneers (correct me if my dates are wrong) for digital, \"smart\" displays. Using companies like On-Star and Sirius, drivers have access to apps like weather, gps, live air pressure readings, and can access call logs and read/listen to received texts from their phone. My truck (2015 Chevy 2500) even has a display on the dash that shows how the truck is tilting. After as little as a year, there's many technological advancements and tweaks that can be done to the OSes that can make them faster, more sleek, and less clunky. Things like a night-mode toggle, customizable backgrounds/themes, and yearly updates can make these displays so much better. Manufacturers could charge a rate for an optional yearly upgrade, say maybe $50 per year, or an upfront unlimited fee when the buyer actually buys the car, maybe $250 because in 5 years these displays just won't have hardware that could compete with the newer models. They could have an option for a recommended (easy) setup, or an advanced setup when you buy the car. Investing in better screens and displays will most likely raise the interest level in this idea as well, because even the screen in my truck is a little insensitive and needs some pressure to tap something, and the screen is actually pretty grainy. I know it may seem expensive for the manufacturer, but if you're buying a $50k (maybe even less) and up vehicle, they shouldn't just give you a crappy display. Something like the screen on an iPhone 6S or the new Note should be installed. they're clearer, you can have better resolutions, and they overall quality is better. The gps should implement features like in the google maps app. Live traffic updates, easy to read directions, Waze accident reports, and even the \"Explore\" feature, only useable while stopped of course. I wrote all this while on adderall and on the toilet, so I apologize if my spelling or format is messed up. ",

I do not dare to look upon people who are under privilege, but in fact I feel sorry for people in those circumstances and sympathise for them.  \n\nAs we all know in this day and age the prices of housing accommodation and affordable is sky rocketing so high making the average person struggle to purchase their first property. A lot of people are paying way to much rent, by the time they have been renting for 20+ years they might as well take a loan from the bank and purchase their own property. But it's not all that easy. Some people have been renting for all their lives and still barley getting by. \n\nIn Buddhism I believe the more we desire the more it leads to suffering. In life we only need 3 things to survive a happy life, they are water, food and shelter. Other than that everything is a illusion to make us happy. We only need those 3 things and our basic living of life on this planet is complete. \n\nI believe in micro housing will be more out there in the future. Micro housing is a solution to affordable accommodation that is attainable compared to purchasing a house. Micro housing tends to be 1/8th cheaper than the average house, but it has everything compressed into one unit. \n\nMicro housing is so efficient that it can fit approximately 10 small housing on a 10x20m property, instead of 1. Imagine if micro housing was implemented into a suburb that is 500mx500m. Imagine how much housing and accommodation that will provide for people. \n\nIt's all about Supply and Demand. The more we want something the more the demand is. How ever there's another barrier that comes into play which is politics and money. \n\nBeing in a western world and coming from a family from a 3rd world country, prices of land is increasing dramatically by the day. Most of us want to be close to the vicinity of the CBD as possible as it's wear of the most resources are, compared to being in the country side. If housing prices start to be cheaper in the country side, people will tend to move out the city due to affordable rates. But the government want's people to work longer and pay for thing's out of reach, making us pay more tax dollars longer, they want to be controlled of how we dictate our lives. \n\nThe demand for housing is a joke, especially where I am from. It is so absurd that there needs to be a solution, a solution to give back to society, a solution to give shelter to every human life on this earth. No one deserves to be homeless or evicted due to financial situations. \n\nI just have a vision of a perfect world where every one on this earth has access to basic fundamentals, I want to see the world moving forward, but in reality we are moving backwards. \n\nJust a idea.  \n",

I can then go online and see the exact number they have left and if they are out it would tell you if there are more on order and an estimated delivery time.\n\n  The best part is this would work well for the store AND the consumer.\n\n  I imagine it would work with networked scanners as things go in and out.  A case of whatever comes in, gets scanned and the system knows how many individual #s of those items come in a case and then it can add that to the in stock and as they are sold the system can count off 1 by 1.\n\n  This would eventually eliminate the amount of phone calls that business' would have to deal with as people could easily just look themselves online.",

I think it could be very helpful to people who feel intimidated by coding's perceived complexity.\n\n**Edit:** Some great points being made in the comments. Simplicity isn't necessarily something to strive for in a coding language.\n\nHowever, before this thread dies, what do you guys think I some kind of command center app from which you could automate more menial tasks? Same idea as the book *Automate the Boring Stuff with Python*, but for computer stuff, and in an app.\n\nExample: \"Simon, ^(^^I ^^named ^^it ^^Simon) in Example.doc, how probable is it that 'this' will be followed within 5 words by 'that',\" or \"If a string in Randata.txt starts with a series of integers of length >10, to move the series of letters following it to Table.xls.\" <-actual problem I had the other day\n\nAt best, it's a great interface that gets simple tasks done automatically for more people would ever learn to program, with new instructions being spoken and understood faster than they'd be programmed. At worst, it's a dumb app that's marginally easier than coding languages, sometimes. \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af",

When the damage is done, there is no guarantee that Google Maps or something similar is good enough to pinpoint the exact location. \n\nHence my idea. Imagine a small foldable drone that you can keep  in the trunk of your car or a backpack. It has one and only one purpose: To hover high above the scene of an accident and blink strong red LED-lights in 360-degrees, visible from far far away. It would serve two purposes; to guide emergency personell to the location and warn / inform oncoming traffic that something has happened. This has multiple usages, beyond traffic as well; out on the sea, shooting up an emergency flare can usually be the last glimmer of hope. With the drone, even if it gets caught in the wind, at least SAR has some more indication as to the area. Also in aviation; a plane crahes in water, but moments before impact it releases the drone which hovers above (and maybe also tracks where it got set off?) \n\n",

We're talking Deadpool meets Elan (Read Order of the Stick). He's even aware of the respawn mechanics, which he'll call Time Machine Bookmarks. \n\nHe acknowledges your presence, will obey your \"advice\" to a certain extent, but has free will. If you kill him repeatedly, he'll stop listening and do something else, and if you make him mad he'll even play Opposite Day. \n\nIt could be a combination of text game and top-down or platformer. On the map and in some rooms you tell him where to go with the arrows, but you always have a text input for giving specific commands like those interactive literature apps on early PCs. \n\nLet's make the game itself similar to Nethack, but with a scifi plot about a programmer who uploaded his brain but accidentally imported it as a game AI. Of course, actual graphics are a must-have too. \n\nI got the idea from the webcomic thing called [Awful Hospital](http://bogleech.com/awfulhospital). (Squick warning). The main character hears the comments as voices in her head, and thus it's an interactive comic where the characters can refuse to obey commands.

Perhaps which jacket too etc. \n\nFurthermore, if you don't own the particular article of clothing, the app itself could link you to particular deals going on now, and perhaps where you can purchase such, from varying price ranges.\n\nYay or nay?

            "selftext": "Hello r/lightbulb, I'm from NY I'm 26 years old and I currently work a not so well paying job, but in my off-time I'm always looking for ventures where I could possibly make extra income and eventually make it an actual job. Also with my free time I like to think of ideas as do all of you, so I'm in beginning phases of Entrepreneurial life. I realized being an Entrepreneur is one of the hardest things in life because 95% of businesses or ideas will fail. \nOne thing I've realized through my ways is there isn't a real way of finding guidelines or advice on which direction to go with your business/idea/service for people who don't have many connections or money to really get the idea from paper to actual brick and mortar storefront, product, or service etc... \n\n\nI'm thinking of setting up a website which would obviously require help from people smarter than me where people can be given opportunities to submit ideas for review through a board, where people would pay a fee to submit the idea for review, we would have a network of large corporations and their managers who have the purchasing power for new ideas. It would allow people with no much capital to submit ideas for a not large fee and get professional criticism from a board of reviewers who are qualified and also if ideas are liked unanimously it would be submitted further for the possibility of large corporations to potentially invest into the company or have first and/or exclusive rights to purchase the product for their store/brand only. \n\nI would like to hear some thoughts on this if you think there's a possibility here or am I just wasting time.\nThanks everyone for reading this.

As an example you could place them below the space bar where your thumb might sit during a right handed bout of PC gaming.Then, when you need to reload, instead of reaching for the R Key wayyy to the right, you could just inch your thumb down a tiny bit. \n\nAdditionally this would be a good companion/replacement for some higher end multi-button mouses like the razer naga. gaining additional functionality in a more ergonomic location suited to the individual, rather than the masses!",

In my opinion it would be great if a company like Amazon (or Apple, or Google) did this for free, but I can even imagine a for-profit company tackling this.\n\nI would be great if you could browse a catalog of charities (with various filters) combined with a shopping cart for the donations. It would easily be possible to split for example your $100 charity budget into 5 or more charities without having all the hassle of getting the payment information and filling out forms. One stop donating. Even very small amounts could be processed effectively and a charity organization would get one big payment for example each day, instead of 500 small ones they have to process individually. Charity organizations had a way to present themselves to the public (fewer marketing costs to get name recognition and to promote your website) and it would be much easier to find the relevant information for your choice in a charity organization. It would be easy to compare without having to browse various websites. It would also prevent fraud.\n\nSuch a site would also be great for marketing like donation-matching or banners for high donations. There's also a possibility for all kinds of social media interaction I can't even imagine now, but for example you could find ways to connect donors or to recruit volunteers. \n\nAll in all I can't see why this is not a thing already.",

Most people don't know that San Diego has a rich history in refugee resettlement. It's estimated that between 1 in 40 (or as many as 1 in 25) county residents has a refugee background.\n\nThat's the context for our work: Advancing the inclusion of refugees in the local economy and democracy. We just made our first video about our new campaign, so any and all feedback is much appreciated.\n\n...And if you like it, please share ;)",

Basically people who have spent years grinding on a game, getting the best equipment but then they may get bored of the game and want to move on or maybe they just dont have the time to play it anymore. While there are many forums out there that allow users to sell their accounts, these are often too over clogged with scammers and people with low level accounts selling for $1. My idea is to find people who have actual valuable accounts, valued at $1000 or more and i will act as a broker for them, find buyers, sell the account, act as a go between and ensure no party is screwed over in the process. Now the site itself would be pretty basic, only listing the accounts currently available and i would only be selling a a max of 10 accounts at a time. The seller would pay me nothing if the account doesn't sell. It would be similar to the website empireflippers.com except for MMO accounts. Be as honest as possible.",

            "selftext": "It's to everyone who creates (or is going to create) anything: writers, painters, designers, photographers, musicians, programmers, poets, filmmakers etc. Beginners as well as professionals, everyone is welcome. I believe we could help each other make our art more transcendent by combinning our forces. We can break the boundaries and go beyond the traditions of what's been done before in our spheres by working together, merging our skills and creative ideas.\n\nI guess it's best to explain what I mean with the help of example. I've been thinking about how to make writing more powerful with the help of technology and I have this vague idea. Let's say I've written a story (I did ;), but I'd like it to be more than just text. Maybe it could be recorded as a audiobook, together with music and visuals. And I don't mean making a classical film or cartoon out of it, the visuals could be abstract, just reflecting the mood or feelings. Something that can be listened to, but also watched. So that text, music and video work together, affecting the viewer more deeply. I really haven't thought it through, so if any of you have any ideas or would like to criticise me or maybe help in creating something like this - I'll be glad :).\n\nBut in general I'd like it to be the place where creators who have a project in mind can find associates to make it real. Where we can enhance our abilities by merging with the talents of others. Where we can discuss our creative ideas, help, motivate and criticise each other, etc. Let's say you've written some music and want a picture to go with it on youtube, so you are looking for an artist who'll listen to it and make your sound visual, you are a poet who wants a website, or even better, you have an idea of creating something absolutely original that hasn't existed before... \n\nLet me know if anyone is interested, all the ideas are always welcome! :)\n\n(I'm not sure that's the right place to submit, but I hope so :)",

            "selftext": "There are lots of services on computers and mobile devices that have once-per-day offers. Plenty of games, for example, that will give you some free content if you log in once per day. And that's great, except that they all have different times when \"per day\" is considered, and when the day rolls over. Usually it depends on where the service developers are located.\n\nThis creates situations where some people can get a \"double.\" Consider a game that gives you a bonus coin every day based on New York time. A player in New York could, if he cared to, wait until 11:59 PM to collect one reward, then collect another one a minute later, and then leave the game idle for 47 hours and 59 minutes without having lost a day. A player in California could do the same thing at 9:00 at night. But a player in England who wanted to pull off this trick has to get up at 5 in the morning. \n\nThis is not equitable. It's discriminating based on where you happen to live. \n\nMy proposal is that we set all one-a-day offers to roll over at midnight of GMT+3. This way, the least desirable hours for roll-overs, 3 AM and 4 AM, land in China, which tends to have different internet services and games from the Western world. \n\nUnder this scenario, everyone in Europe could get their double-ups after the supper hour when they have time to be on their phones and computers. People in California could check in at the end of the noon lunch hour right before going back to work. Or they, and everyone in the western hemisphere, could get their bonus at night, but secure in the knowledge that if they forget, it'll still be there in the morning. \n\nWestern Australians would have a bit of a rough time, having the 5-in-the-morning slot, but the rest of Australia wouldn't be too bad, and I'd consider GMT+2 as an alternative so that folks in the Central and Eastern Australian time zones could get the 7 and 8 slots, respectively. Just a question of whether we want to make it easier for the Aussies or the Middle Easterners. ",

            "selftext": "The library of babel is a website that has every single combination of lower-case letters, commas, space an periods of up to 3200 symbols. On one page in this website there is a description of how you are going to die, what your job will be and etc. This is a real website :https://libraryofbabel.info/\n\nNow this got me thinking, could we do the same with pixels?\n\nA computer can showcase about 16.8 million different colors, and a facebook profile picture (for example) consists of a minimum of 160x160 pixels. Now this got me thinking, could you create every image ever with the same methods used in the Library of Babel? so far my answer to this is yes, but I am only some random 16 year old kid from Norway that has no experience whatsoever with these kind of ideas.\n\nLet's say Library of Babel starts out with 3200 letters of a, then abaaaaaaaa etc., pretty sure they didn't start out that way, but let's say they did. This could very well be translated over to pixels as long as you have a limit, whether it's 160x160 or 1920x1080.\n\nSo if you start with the first pixel in the lower left corner, and make that the next shade of white on the 16.8 million color spectrum we could keep doing that till we have all the combinations. Just for fun we could calculate how many different pictures there would have been. Now I am pretty bad at math, but in order to find out the amount of pictures I multiplied 160 times 160 and got 25600. I then multiplied that by 16.8 million and got this huge number I have no idea how to pronounce: 430080000000\n\nNow what is so interesting about this you may ask? Or you may be sweating in excitement because of this concept, I don't know. haven't really shared the idea to anyone before.\n\nWell the very cool part about this is that if I, in 2085, when I will be 85 (hard math) decide to take a futuristic selfie of my very old self and my grandkids and use that as my profile picture, then it won't be the first time that picture was \"made\"! Let's say I, or anyone for that matter, make a website of this, making this concept into reality and make it also a search engine, just for fun, like Google has. You know the one where you can drag in a picture and see where that picture has been used across the internet? Anyways. If I then did a search with that very picture that I just took, then I could find the same EXACT photo only that it was made by a computer back in the old days of 2016!\n\nSo if someone made this today, then you could browse through the trillions of combinations and find a picture of your future self, the formula to cure cancer or even a naked photograph of your hot neighbor!!\n\nAll that through the power of science\n\nIf you have any idea of this being possible, any experience, questions or anything like that please send me a mail or maybe just a tweet @Trulstei117 or trulstei@gmail.com\n\nIf you win a nobel prize for bringing this idea to life then I better be in your speech, Truls Steinsvik, the next master genius that gave away his billion dollar idea for free over the internet. A true genius indeed.",

            "selftext": "Ok, so I've seen a lot of concepts/games that are *similar* to this, but none that tie everything together. \n\nThe basic idea is a horror game that punishes you for being scared. The more scared you are, the more scary things happen, and the more scared you get, etc.\n\nThis is an online multiplayer game that needs a few peripherals. The game is played through VR, every user needs to have a mic, and everyone needs to be hooked up to a heart rate monitor (This could be plugged into a USB port or something, I'm imagining it to be like the Nintendo [Vitality Sensor](http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/nintendo/images/c/cd/VitalitySensor.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20090622170507&path-prefix=en). \n\nThe basis of this game is very similar to Left 4 Dead or Evolve, with bits of Amnesia mixed in. There are 4 \"Survivors\" who are trying to defeat 1 \"Monster\". The monster's goal is to kill all 4 survivors. The monster cannot see very well, so everything appears blurry to him. However, it has incredible hearing. If the survivors say anything, or their heart rate increases, the Monster is able to hear this in order to pinpoint the location of the Survivors. So the survivors have to stay as quiet as possible to win. The monster cannot be hurt or killed.\n\nThe maps will all be user-generated. Each map will be required to have an objective that the survivors need to do in order to win (steal an artifact and return it to their base, restore electricity to a mansion in order to call for help, escape a forrest, etc.). Each map that is used is a random map taken from the monster's maps (e.g. if I'm the monster, the map that is used for that game is taken from the maps I have created, so I know the territory). The map can be covered in all sorts of jump scares are scary elements in order to try and get the survivors to cry out or have their heart rates increase. The maps can also have weaker AI monsters to act as jump scares/scouts, these CAN be killed.\n \nSurvivors can be one of several classes, here's just a few but I'm probably going to come up with quite a lot to add variety.\n\nSoldier: Can deal out damage, but guns make a lot of noise\n\nEngineer: Can interact with electrical equipment\n\nMedic: Heals wounded/dead allies\n\nMonster Hunter: Can Sense/Track/Find monsters with ease\n\nThief/Ninja: Can hide his heartbeat/voice from the monster for periods of time\n\nInventor: Can build useful gadgets using parts from around the map\n\nJournalist: Can use the keyboard to send text-messages to teammates (there will be no team chat in the game).\n\nDemolitions Expert: Can break into locked doors\n\nExorcist: Can repel monsters for a short period of time\n\nDetective: Can use clues to figure out information about the map layout\n\nHopefully, the map building can be completely open source and players could even make their own monsters/scary things/other elements and add them into the game, keeping the game fresh and unique.\n\n\nThe 2 main problems I see are:\n\n1. The tech isn't quite there yet. I think have a mic, vital reader, AND a VR headset is a bit much, plus, it's going to be hard to play a PC game when one of your fingers has a big sensor on it.\n\n2. Staleness, this game requires fear to be interesting, and if a player plays the game and sees all there is to see, then the game becomes less scary and the entire idea goes out the window, this is why the player-based map building is so important, as well as having regular updates of scares/scary elements from both the designers and players alike in order to keep things fresh.

Then that individual reproduces, and maybe it escapes into the wild, and later on has to be treated with antibiotic B, but by this point in time it has formed a second large population, so there's a chance of another individual appearing in the new population which has resistance to both A and B. The longer the gap between the first and second treatment, the larger the population, the greater the chance.\n\nSo using the antibiotics one at a time is setting evolution up with nice easy incremental steps. Use both A and B together in the first place, and the odds are much better of the whole original population being wiped out, including any mutant that could resist one of either A or B.\n\nI don't know if it's actually OK to mix antibiotics like this, I was just amused by the thought, because standard wisdom for avoiding resistant bugs is \"go easy on antibiotics\", yet maybe *if you're going to use them at all* it's most ethical to gobble down every kind in sight.

I know there are massive differences between say UK (me), US, and other politics, but lets simplify. The traditional 50% are voted in representing areas/constituencies .\n\nThe other 50% of government is voted in by the leading academics of that country. These people are voted in, almost like a national service. Voted for by fellow academics, broken down into the main industries/social areas. So finance, healthcare, military etc etc.\n\nPerhaps each of the leading Universities could have one, two or a handful of representatives. So UK could have 3 from Oxford, 3 from Cambridge, University College London, St Andrews and so on.\n\nThe idea being that instead of politics being fought on an essentially PR and Marketing theatre, these battles would take place within Academic circles. And therefore the reputations of these academics, Doctors and Professors would be a primary motivator, as opposed to corporate sponsorship and marketing to the public.\n\nOK, so there are still teething issues. I'd imagine academics are equally tempted by corporate money as career politicians. But still, at least we'd have clever people with a major say in the country instead of the likes of George Osbourne - our Chancellor of the Exchequer - he has a degree in History and the closest economic qualification is an O Level math. \n",

Let me open this up:\n\nI just googled new tech stuff when I stumbled onto this: https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-hololens/en-us\nI've always been a huge fan of holographic tech and it's just grown with the Iron Man movies. Could this tech be achievable by low-budget or homemade if it would be customed a little? Or if not with glasses, then what about holographic tablet?\n\nThis is an incredibly abstract and not finished idea. Just thought that there'd be other people that are interested in and thinking about technology like this. Give me your thoughts!",

For example: a drone can't move through sensitive airspace, but could revert to maglev till it clears the restriction. Or just part-trip-maglev for cross country economy and speed.

What I would like to control is the strength of the magnets at any moment and their polarity. I want to be able to switch if it is an attracting force or a repelling force.\n\nOn the hand you wear a glove which have an even layer of metal that reacts to these magnets so that the force of the magnets can be applied to the hand. This can create a force feedback loop for the user.\n\nThe alternative idea is putting sensors on the base and have it scan your hand above it. That way it could be a much more variable device. You could bind gestures to functions things you want to do. I like to imagine it will bring pc gaming closer to it feeling like there may one day be a comprehensive virtual 3D environment that mimics real life things that we can not yet experience through human to computer interfacing.\n\nI prefer the first idea because you can code for pressure feedback which can be used to make virtual worlds feel like they physically exist but applying force back on the user. If we go down this route you can create a whole body suit which lies over a larger base of magnets and through the ability to control the magnets with a computer by changing their polarity and strength you can create full virtual 3D environments that you can feel and even interact with. This can be used in many more applications than gaming or 3D environments. ",

The age will be hidden as they browse, and when a person finds an animal that looks like they connect to them, they can then guess the age, then click to see the age. eventually less and less they will care about how old the animals are because they see that a few years havent ruined them, and that way, older animals are given a better chance.",

Now we know google glass works by using a projector and a prism. So why not just make this bigger, and as for the touch sensor, there are many other more effective ways to achieve a touchscreen, but I am not a engineer or scientist, so I just thought of what I know. Like a projector keyboard, use sensors. Here's a neat little diagram of how a \"Magic cube\" keyboard works. http://www.celluon.com/images/how_it_works.png\n\nOh and for reference, here's how google glass works: http://www.kurzweilai.net/images/howglassworks.jpg\n\nSo here's my messy as hell, most likely flawed, idea.\nhttp://i.imgur.com/7seFCje.jpg\n\nWould love to get some feedback and opinion and insight on this idea. I know it's not perfect but filled some spare time thinking about it. Is it possible?  The blocks at the top and bottom would obviously be where all the components would fit. I wasn't thinking about size for this keep in mind, I'm not looking for it to be slim. \nIf this is possible this is something I would like to try and build, i just need some outside view.",

            "selftext": "The phrase \"bottled emotions\" came to mind recently and I thought about it in a literal sense and how it sounded cool to put emotions in a bottle. Humans are complex emotional creatures so it'd be neat to have any kind of drink reflect this. Of course this drink wouldn't be anything that actually affected your emotions. It looks like someone attempted to make a [brand of vodka](http://www.packagingoftheworld.com/2010/03/mixed-emotions.html) that did just that which I assume is why it didn't take off. I thought of it as a soft drink since that's what I originally pictured selling successfully. That and pop and alcohol are more typically bottled than other juices I've seen (in terms of glass anyways). For the sake of being healthy, however, it could also be a brand of juice.\n\n---\n# Original Drink\n---\n\nBased on the basic emotions minus \"*disgust*\", because who wants to drink something labelled that? Unless it was some sort of April Fool's joke or some sort of rare joke flavor. That leaves five flavors of **happiness**, **sadness**, **fear**, **anger**, and **surprise**. I imagine each flavor would basically be based off of various fruit tastes or maybe something entirely different altogether to make it interesting. It should be as easily digestible as a soft drink could be (so avoid really harmful and excess ingredients) and use natural sugar. That's about as far as my soft drink knowledge extends so the rest of the chemical components are up in the air. \n\n---\n# Alcoholic Version\n---\n\nUtilizes more complex (or just stronger versions of) emotions as flavor inspirations. My reasoning is that alcohol can be seen as sophisticated in some ways and consumed by adults who are likelier to feel more complex emotions than a younger demographic. Flavors would be in more variety due to the numerous amount of complex emotions and alcoholic drinks/mixes in existence. Keeping opposites in mind (which would be sold separately if possible), examples could be but not limited to: \n\nPositive | Negative\n--------|--------\nLove | Hatred\nPride | Shame\nCompersion | Jealousy\nTrust | Doubt\nEmpathy | Apathy\nEuphoria | Anxiety\nClarity | Confusion\nPatience | Frustration\nRelaxation | Stress\nRespect | Disdain\nAdmiration | Scorn\nSatisfaction | Regret\nComposure | Embarrassment\nExcitement | Boredom\n\n---\n# Organic Version\n---\n\nIf there is such a thing as an organic soft drink. I also like the idea of it being straight up juice. It'd be labelled \"Raw Emotions\" and could have more intense flavor names such as **rage**, **ecstasy**, **terror**, **amazement**, and **grief** with \"*loathing*\" being the joke flavor equivalent of \"disgust\".\n\n[Edits for formatting]",

Or, vise versa, I wish I could say \"THANK YOU\" to the guy who let me merge. \n\nHere's the idea, & how it works.\n\nFirst and foremost, to use the app, you'd need to register your own car with the app. This creates a \"Wall\" similar to other social media platforms, that allows you and other users to post onto. \n\nYou can search other cars via their Licence plate no. To prevent you from using the app whilst driving, the app locks itself if it detects you driving. You'd need to enter the info at a stop light or when you arrive at your destination. Maybe you'd be able to search via car type & color, or using an auto-detect software that reads pictures of plates.\n\nEach Licence Plate has its own feed- which includes user comments, pictures, \"Karma\" score, and *(TRAFFIC VIOLATION HISTORY).*\n\nNow, I realize most people would only use this to post negative things about other cars- but that's the brilliance of this app. It works, in a sense, to allow drivers to pass justice onto bad drivers and publicly shame them in the process.

            "selftext": "So, the idea is that everybody would start with a 10 virtual credits, 1 of Material A, a 1 of Material B, a 1 of Material C, and 1 of material D.\n\nYour goal: Earn the most credits and materials.\n\nHow to make materials:\n\nYou'd be able to \"mine\" materials by paying credits per hour to get money. For example, I could spend 3 credits a hour to get 2 of material A a hour. It could be a command like:\n\nmine A 4\n\nHow does it work? So A is the material you're getting, and 4 is the amount you're getting per hour. If x was the amount of materials, here is the formula for cost per hour, with y being the cost:\n\ny = 1.5x\n\nOnce you've got the materials, you could sell it to other people for an increased price, making credits. \n\nHowever, you could make \"compounds\", a system where you can combine materials. You could do that for 2 A, and 1 B, and it would look like this:\n\ncom 2A B bob\n\nIf you notice the \"bob\" at the end, that is just simply naming the product bob.\n\nThen, you'd be charged a small fee, and you could make that anytime by doing. :\n\ncom bob\n\nNow, what you could do is create a \"trademark\" of a compound. You could do:\n\nTM bob 20\n\nThe last number is the credits someone will have to pay you to create that compound. To upkeep that compound, you would have to pay 50 credits a day, making it only profitable if 3 are created.\n\nThe formula for upkeep is:\n\ny = 2.5x\n\nBut, you're probably wondering, why create compounds? Here's why. The formula for calculating the worth of compounds is below. The formula is shown with the earlier compound \"bob\"\n\ne = no. of items in compound, f = number of unique items in the content\n\ny = 1/2f(e^2)\n\ny = 1(3^2)\n\ny = 1(9)\n\ny = 9\n\nYou'd earn 9 credits from \"bob\", and only expend 4.5 and 1 hour, making a profit of 4.5 credits. \n\nReason I can't pull this off: It needs complex auto-bots\n\nEDIT: Formula(s) simplified.\n\nEDIT2&3: Formula(s) slightly less OP and simplified \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

            "selftext": "I did this speech in COM 101 last semester on why I believe too few people make way too much money and how that cripples the majority. Obviously most people's solution to that is to raise the minimum wage. Which would be effective, if it wasn't for the fact that the people at the top plan on keeping their same insane profit margins. Meaning that they'd need to raise the prices of goods or cut jobs to spend the same relative amount of money for the labor. I think that if CEO's decided that instead of making 50 mil they could live off 1 mil they could then distribute the extra cash fairly and pay people more without raising costs. But who would willingly cut their pay that much right? So I think there should be a federally enforced income cap. Just an idea. Idk where the excess money would go or anything yet. Still an idea in the works. But do you think that would be a realistic policy to instate? Just tryna bounce the idea off more heads",

I don't want to watch a review or explanation (last time I tried watching the 15 overview about the full Assassins Creed story and my brain almost melted out of my eyes), I just want to watch the story first hand. So I was thinking it would be great to edit together all the cut scenes and very minimal gameplay together so that it feels like you're watching a movie. No voiceovers. No narration. No menu clicks or inventory checks. No 10 minute shots of a character running across a field. If the cut scene ends with someone saying \"We need to find that item\", then just show the character interacting around for a minute or two and then cut to the next cutscene, after finding the item. This way, I can just sit down and enjoy a 2 hour film about BioShock, instead of watching someone else play it for 40 hours.\n\nEdit for clarity. And just to throw in... Is it possible to create these for Halo, Assassins Creed, BioShock, MassEffect and others I don't know of?\n\nEdit 2: OK I just realized this would actually be perfect for the video game companies themselves. I would gladly pay $5-$10 for the movie version. I mean you have the content already, and it would cost next to nothing to make.

Put them in a chamber and shoot it to Mars (Of course with adequate shields and airbags, like Curiosity) Slowly open one compartment at a time so that the bacteria get gradually accustomed to Martian climate. Let them evolve and learn to thrive on Mars, let them fill the planet with a ton of CO2, pretty much cause global warming.\n\nMars is tiny, it's never going to hold enough air for us to breathe properly so the least we can do is have the atmosphere at least get better at holding heat.\n\nSo, by the time we get there, things are a little better for us and there's a bunch.",

            "selftext": "I often run into [deleted video] on my youtube playlists and I want to know what the video was.  You can almost always find a mirror of the video if you know the title, so it would be nifty if a website cached the titles to youtube videos.  There are 3 big hurdles to overcome here:\n\n1. Manipulating and storing the data: Youtube has roughly [1 billion](https://www.quora.com/How-many-videos-have-been-uploaded-to-YouTube) videos.  Each one of those has a video ID 11 chars long and a title of variable length up to 100 chars.  This means you would need at least (1,000,000,000 * 8 bytes * (11 + 100)) = 888GB to store the video data.  A 1TB of storage isn't too much; however, maintaining a database of 1 billion rows is going to be cumbersome.\n\n2. Getting the data from Youtube.  I am not at all familiar with the Youtube API, but you would need to be able to get a list of all videos uploaded to youtube, and videos as they are being uploaded.  The API has a [list](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/search/list#parameters) call that lest you get 1,000,000 videos back at a time. Each call costs 100 units and you are allowed 1,000,000 units per day.  There is a publishedBefore and publishedAfter parameter so you could run the query for specific timer intervals in order to get all the videos.  It would take some time but I think it is possible.  There's also the problem of user's editing their title, but I'm just going to ignore that and hope that the original title is enough information.\n\n3. Will Google allow it?  I haven't looked into how Google grants YouTube api access and whether or not they revoke it, but I could see them having a problem with storing information about deleted videos. \n\nIf anyone wants to shoot some holes through this or has any input at all please comment.\n",

            "selftext": "I was just thinking about Amazon's drone delivery, and I remember reading that their goal was to have a range of 10 miles. Well we already have a network of nodes with a clear view of the sky, much denser than 10 mile radius, almost always within a mile of any city address. So why can't cell towers serve as drone base stations? Imagine a network of cell towers, each with a number of drones addressed to it. When a package is shipped a drone flies it for a short distance to the nearest cell tower and relays it to one of the tower's drones. That drone, in turn, relays the package to the next, and so on until the final end-point drone nearest the shipping address delivers the package. Each drone, after relaying or delivering a package simply returns to the tower it was addressed to.\n\n\nAdditionally:\n\n- towers are already mapped by FAA\n\n- networked routes ensure the drones are never out of communication\n\n- drones would be able to charge wirelessly while next to a cell tower\n\n- easy to reroute packages\n\n- automated range of > 10 miles",

The display changed color depending on how loud you were, and when it turned red, you'd be fined something like $5. The meter rates changed at night, where in the daytime you'd probably never hit the red-zone. \n\nThis could be easily incorporated into apartments. It'd have to be less strict- maybe even disabled during the daytime, and increases the limit as the night goes on. The fine should ONLY occur when excessive noise levels are reached for excessive amounts of time. \n\n\nThis forces residents to keep quiet (Mostly discourages parties), thus keeping the neighbors happy, and the apartment gets a little bit of income from fines. \n\nAs someone who's dealt with neighbors blasting music until 3AM, I know how fucking annoying it is.

This segment was most pleasing and uproarious. I come to you, with the desire of a thousand chuckles, to pitch a film based on this character.\n\nImagine a North Pole much like the Vatican in which Santa Claus is the Pope, and as such is chosen by all the shopping mall Santas across the world to be the next Santa Claus. Once the old Santa has passed or resigned all the Santas from across the land meet at the North Pole to vote on the new Mr Claus. These wise men of the the North decide that Santa needs to be fresh and new so they choose Mr. Ferrell as the new hipper Santa Claus... noice. \n\nThe hijinks will ensue as you are most aware. Maybe Santa is friends with Guy Fieri and the members of Smash Mouth. Of course Dameon will be his best bud overlooking the North Pole while Santa is on his first run distributing gifts throughout the world... via drone. \n\nI am a massively huge fan of both your works and am just throwing this out as a suggestion.\n\nP.S. \u201cStep Brothers\u201d is the second greatest film of all time and I have observed it on multiple occasions. \n\nThank you,\n\nMartin Kalanda\n\nPerson",

That transmitter itself would reroute the call with its current GPS, speed, etc. This transmitter cannot be turned off by pilot controls.\n\n* 2: A special operator dedicated to 119/211 type calls will pick up and the caller can try to say the problem. Operator will also relay the call to the plane's captain so he can listen in.\n\n* 3: The phone will, until physically unable or the operator disconnects from the phone (if the caller hangs up, it will still be tracked from the start), be tracked.\n\n* 4: The operator will also imminently alert the country's airspace radar to keep a eye on that GPS location for strange movements/etc. \n\n* 5: Any false calls (more those without any reply from the caller) will be a felony and added to a no-fly list. This includes jail time and large fines. The reason for the no-fly list because a prank 911 call you usually just waste the police's time.

I want to start going around the college leaving pictures and messages and such for people on the walls of the buildings.

I'd keep an Instagram or Facebook for one place to show all of the things I've done so everyone can see and it can be out in the world. I'm leaning more towards this being down anonymously and me going out at night to do all of the drawing and whatnot. \n\nI want to do this with sidewalk chalk so it can easily be washed off and won't be counted as vandalism or anything. \n\nIf everything with this works out smoothy and I have enough support with this project them I had another idea to go along with this. I would get together a large number of people and we all spend the whole night decorating as much of the campus as we can with positive cute little images and phrases. \n\nWhat do you think?\n\nI can also answer any questions about this if I wasn't clear enough/you want to know more.",

            "selftext": "**Background:** Back in late 1990s and early 2000s, internet cafe was pretty popular. I remember when I used the internet at home through dial-up, my home phone would stop working and my parents would yell at me to stop using the internet. Internet was simply inaccessible.\n\nI think a lot of people want to try virtual reality. I can tell you that IT IS AWESOME. I want to show it to my friends, family, and even my grandparents. I'm currently at an VR/Blockchain accelerator in Silicon Valley so I know a thing or two about the space. I'll admit that we need much more content and it doesn't quite make sense for the consumers to buy it right now. Unless you are a developer, high-end gamer, 3D modeler, or do some kind of video production, you won't have the computers that can even run VR. So in order to have a VR setup, you need a $1500 computer and another $800 for the VR hardware. VR is inaccessible.\n\n**Idea:** Room scale virtual reality space that you can rent. I think $5 per 15 minutes is a good start. Kind of like internet cafe + real world escape rooms.\n\nWhat do you guys think?",

They could make an algorithm that averages out all of these viewing angles for each frame of the video. The person who watches the 360 video can now decide to click a button that will play the video using the averaged out viewing angles.\n\nThe idea is that what the average user wants to see will be considered the \"best shot\" for the 360 video. So now a person who doesn't have VR glasses or Google Cardboard can watch the video as if filmed by an average user.",

This is how I sound and this is how I look.\"\n\n\nI would think once a week would be good - only 52 videos a year.  Maybe once a month would be easier to do.  \n\n\nAnyway, wouldn't it be amazing to eventually see a video compilation going from toddler all the way through old age?  \n\n\nObviously none of us here will see a compilation go all the way to old age, but if someone sees this and starts it today, in 15 years we could see a pretty amazing transformation.\n\n\nSo do it!  Do it now!!\n\nAnd if you're aware of one that's already posted (but apparently hard to find, since I've searched and only found a couple), let me know.

I had an *exceptional* waiter that I know would absolutely kill in a secretarial, customer service, or other employee-to-customer-interaction job.  If some business was doing really well, I'm sure they could buy them out of their waiting job and get that talent on their team.\n\nThen I thought of a business that only highers people through \"word of mouth\" so to speak.  You can't apply to the job, you only can be noticed by employees at the job that think you have good drive and talent, and would be offered an interview.  Obviously this could only work for certain jobs, if it is an engineering firm they won't be finding talented engineers in their day-to-day life for hire.  Or perhaps this strategy could only work for certain positions in the company.\n\nI feel like the exclusivity matched with *knowing* that the person is a hard worker before employing them would give the company a mysterious and elite status.  Kind of like Disney's Imagineers, they aren't supposed to talk about their work, I'm not sure you can even apply for it, or it's at least really competitive to get into, and they do glorious work.",

I might be about to do a terrible job of explaining this, but here goes...\n\nSo you create a matrix of physical volumetric pixels (voxels) in the form of transparent OLEDs, stacked into either a cube, a sphere, or a hemisphere. The 'lens' of each OLED is in the shape of either a cube or another 3D solid shape that will tightly pack with the same shapes around it.\n\nYour electrodes are long, extremely thin strands of a transparent conductive material, sheathed in a transparent insulator. Finding a way to route them down around the other voxels would be very tricky, admittedly\n\nYou then use a form of \"charlieplexing\" (a method for controlling a large number of LEDs from a relatively small number of pins) to connect the voxels to a display driver.\n\nThe key here is to maintain uniform color (or lack thereof) and refraction index with all the disparate transparent components and materials, and also to minimize air gaps that would cause optical distortion. Perhaps embedding the voxel matrix in a specialized epoxy resin would help with the latter.\n\nOne additional wrinkle would be to create a liquid crystal shell around each OLED that switched between clear and translucent to allow for different effects.\n\nI might simply be nuts, but if not...

Then, it exaggerates the patterns, producing awesome looking imagery.\n\nMy idea is a similar program, instead trying to find parts of songs it knows in other music, and then exaggerates them, producing something that echoes the original song, but composed of mostly parts of other songs.\n\nI would do this myself, but I'm very much not up to the task.",

            "selftext": "This may be more of a niche project than most, but I'd like to adapt it to my personal situation.\n\nThe situation:\n\nI live in a very nice 3BR downtown apartment, but my room is an interior room, and thus has no windows. It's not very bothersome, but I'd like to create the illusion that the room does in fact have windows on say 1 wall. \n\nIdea 1: The expensive way. \n\nA couple of LCDs with window frames around them in portrait mode. Would cycle an outdoor picture, maybe a local webcam feed to stay current with both weather and lighting. \n\nIdea 2: The less expensive way\n\nA couple of window frames with permanently closed variably-backlit mini-blinds. Basically I would have two window frames with glass and backlighting behind the glass, and miniblinds on the outside of the glass. The backlighting would be variable-color LEDs that would be set to cycle warmth and luminosity with the sunrise/sunset every day. This could all be run from a RasbPi or arduino. \n\n\nSo as far as materials, I'm still up in the air. I've got years of 12V electronics experience, some arduino and programming experience, and a fabrication shop at my disposal. While I'm looking at this for myself, I think this could be something that could be easily adapted to a commercial product if something like this doesn't already exist. Think interior offices to improve mood etc. \n\nSo my main questions to the community are your general thoughts on feasibility, does anything exist already that would help me in my project, and does anything exist already that is basically what I'm trying to build?",

The latter requiring proof and mod aproval. \n\n- The remaining family may forbid or request deletion of a loved one's page. They may not forbid other pages from mentioning  him/her (without links to a page, since it would not exist).\n\n- Close family MUST be warned if a page is created about someone.\n\n- While still alive, you can make a request to the mods that the website forbids a page about yourself after your death. You can also authorize it, does preventing your family from forbiding it after you die. \n\nNot sure about this one, I feel that there would be a lot of legal issues and controversies:\n\n- The descendants can reverse your decision or previous descendants decision on forbiding the page an X amount of years after the death (if you made the request) or the request (if the family made it). \n\nSorry about the english, here.\n\n\nEdit: My idea here is that society should do what is possible to prevent people from being completely forgotten by history.

The main idea is merely a symbolic sound, reaching with the psychological trees they stated (Self, Uncanny, Other)...\n\nEveryone is familiar with certain machinery, or instruments making music, having a liking of a genre or 2+, and overall other things in their life.\n\nThe way I think this would be different from other Ambient works is that it's more than sound patterns and such that inflict emotional manipulation, but something more about how a horror game or movie is made.\n\nFor example, let's say I start the song with a human moan, (sexual kind) and have it repeat with different moans, while adding delayed voices making the same moan 2 times; yet have a distortion that doesn't detract from the original voice too much.\n\nThis in turn creates an uncanny feel, yet after the 2nd time, no delayed moans happen, instead a distorted piano starts playing an guitar-like baroque ambient track, depicting a ghost. This guitar-piano is put on the right speaker with very little sound (just enough for us to notice), and the moans go on the left.\n\nSoon the entire noise will suddenly stop, only to bring a scream of pain. Random synthesizer sounds start to go crazy, being convoluted more and more, in the sense of pure chaos.\n\nIt all goes down in volume, till it can barely be heard; Then a bell starts to ring, and a voice says ciphered words, with a sound of a dying man needing air. The sound of predators starts.\n\nBird's singing starts, indicating nature and being safe while you hear screams from the same voice that moaned, with 15 SHODAN-like voices (with once again low volume) screaming as well. This is accompanied by a convoluted (what can I say, I love convolute-ing sounds XD) roar with a distorted spectral matrix...\n\nA acoustic guitar and a synthesizer starts, with the acoustic guitar playing a amateur 4 chord song, while the synthesizer is constantly changing noises while playing complete discord. Soon the guitar starts a pattern of a variety of distortions constantly changing while the synthesizer turns into a distorted organ, in which the roles are switched, in which the synthesizer has a mechanical disruptive organ playing the 4 chords, while the guitar's turned to chaos. (this happens while the screaming happens)\n\nThis entire song creates an uncanny and other feeling, while giving a sense of how we lusted for the moaning at the beginning, but turned away from it imaging what happened, in the form that we could've done it...\n\nI am HORRIBLE at creating horror through anything, So please don't judge my song-thing above, but the idea around it :)\n\nedit: I am also not good with musical terms :(, correct me or tell me if something matches this description of music. (to teach me more) And don't be mean about it ;)\n\nalso I am horrible at grammar...",

When switched on, it will vibrate ONLY if there is another DTF Dollar very close nearby (few meters) that is also switched on.\n\nSo let me paint you a picture...\n\nYou're talking to someone cute at work and would love nothing more to just have a quickie with them. Who knows, maybe they are on the same page? But you obviously can't straight up ask \"you wanna go fuck?\" because if they aren't on the same page you are risking a sexual harassment lawsuit. So you switch on your DTF Dollar and low and behold it starts buzzing because they also switched theirs on in hopes you also have one. \n\nOf course, you can always ask them if they would like to go out sometime but then you have to do the whole rigmarole with them. You can skip all that with the DTF Dollar.",

            "selftext": "First off, I'll say the reason I only have a framework is because I can't draw and I don't have a good eye for dialogue, so I can't create this myself:\n\nThe comic is called Frontera- I'd say it's in the vein of an Action-Adventure novel in the style of Steve Berry or James Rollins, but the characters have \"super-powers\" rooted in comics that are seemingly plausible.\n\nThe three main characters are Maricruz Ortiz, a 20-yr old Gutemalan woman, her partner, Perci Jimenez, a 19-yr old Colombian man, and Rafe Shutter, a 45-50-yr old Ivy League Biology professor. \n\nEach has a unique gift - Mari has a PAX7 mutation that increases her satellite cell generation and gives her control of her bodies muscle growth, she also has manual control of her body's adrenal flow and nervous system. The result is that she has increased speed and strength that have potential to grow as she learns to control her physiology.\n\nPerci has enhanced visual acuity due to the regulation of his ocular-neural connectors. He is able to see items in detail miles further than a regular human. He also has tetrachromatic eyes which give him access to a spectrum of light called the \"flux lines\". The \"flux lines\" are a spectrum of light that link an object to a focal point. Perci is able to break the links and manipulate objects from far away. It's like holding your fingers in front of your eye and pinching a building. The more flux lines Perci is able to perceive and the distance from the objects effects his ability's potency.\n\nRafe has Eidetic memory.\n\nIn the beginning of the story, Mari and Perci are coyotes, smuggling kids from Mexico into Texas. The are notoriously known by the nicknames La Aguila and El Buho. They're latest run is being tracked by a border patrol squad headed up by Joseph Svoboda, and his two team leaders Miguel Lopez and Bradley Miller. Lopez is the overzealous tool who has his ear on the ground and wants proof that it's not a huge smuggling operation but a small team of powered people. Miller is a fratboy former hedge-fund manager from New York who took the BP job to escape some investors he screwed. Mari and Perci are able to deliver the children to their contact and escape the BP, but not without leaving a trail that Lopez, Svoboda, and helicopter pilot Dominic Keys being to pursue but are redirected at the directive of commander Angela Reiter to stop a potential drug run by the Zuniga cartel near Piedras Negras. Lopez is given a team of Mexican Federal Police and BP agents as well as Keys' air support.\n\nOnce Mari and Perci get paid, their layers begin to show- Mari only wants men and drink, Perci wants to see the world, they flip for it and head to the Grand Canyon, hitching rides all the way there, with a stop in El Paso at a safehouse ran by Lady Harrison, who puts the burden of responsibility on the two to help Mexico from the violence instead of act selfishly.\n\nMiller takes his men to a bar in a bordertown and they are robbed and one of them is shot by a dirty police officer, a mysterious good Samaritan named Ana Mercedes Salazar Valdez rushes them to the hospital and tells Miller to contact her. His man dies.\n\nRafe's story starts with him giving a lecture on his hypothesis over the human mind's ability to consciously regulate the body's physiological systems. He dismisses the class for Spring Break and hops on a plane for Veracruz, Mexico where he meets a woman. They talk and he eventually tells her he is headed to the region east of Xalapa, where folk stories have stayed consistent and dense for hundreds of years, meaning they have some validity to them. She asks what stories and he tells her the tale of the \"Santo de las Hayas\" and the \"Mesillas Family\". The \"Santo\" story is that an inept catholic priest commits suicide and does in the after life what he could not while he lived; helped the helpless. \"Mesillas\" tells the tale of a feral human family who raids villages like beasts and steal bad children. Once he lands, he meets a young Mexican man named Antonio (To\u00f1o) Gutierrez who assists him in his quest to learn more about the two legends, they start w/ an old man in the village who leads them to a historian in a neighboring town. They end up finding a cave with Aztec symbols, and run into feral humans like in the story, they escape the beasts, but get lost in the process. When they get out, they're met by tribal-looking guards with advanced military weaponry and meet a woman who calls herself Vigilar Prima. They are taken to an upgraded looking Aztec temple and meet the Adivina who begins to unfold the origins of \"Santo\" and \"Mesillas\".\n\nLopez and Keys mission plan for the Zunigas is to have four checkpoints after being tipped off that they were running w/ four semi-trucks, possibly 3 of which are decoys. They are betrayed by one of the Mexican Feds who ends up being like the Mesillas beasts, and kills his checkpoint team, Lopez and Keys try to stop him but they are overpowered. Lopez is left for dead, Keys' body is taken.\n\nSvoboda is given the mission to find out how a mole passed their background check when they assembled the team. He takes a team to Mexico and to the agents HQ where they are given printed records of his Twitter and emails. They go to his house and find his body hanging from the living room ceiling and flayed. They take what evidence they can find and as they attempt to cross the border back into the US, the guards try to kill them, but they escape.\n\nMiller is suspended for his mishandling of  his men, and contacts Ana Mercedes on a whim. They meet at a restaurant, and it seems fine until she reveals that her company, Salazar Investments, is interested in finding the powered people that evaded the BP, she blackmails Miller into helping her. Miller ends up teaming up with Lopez, to find out more about the people.\n\nMari and Perci visit the Grand Canyon since it was Perci's choice. They end up saving a group of tourists who's raft flips in the rapids. They think they get away without being seen, but another tourist captures it all on camera from the rim of the canyon. The pair camp at night near Temple and Chuar Butte, the \"haunted\" part of the canyon, where Perci has a vision:\n\nIn the vision, Perci wakes up, the world is all flux lines, he looks down at Mari, she is in a deep sleep. He sees one line that is stronger than all the other lines. He tries to tug at it but it won\u2019t budge. It lights up at his touch and seems to be leading somewhere. He decides to follow it. The line weaves around the canyon walls it decends into the canyon and into a cave. Perci pauses but the line lights up, urging him on. He walks into a cave and immediately sees a sipapu (a hole where Indians believe is the gateway to the afterlife) The line turns into a web of flux lines on the sipapu ground. Suddenly ancient spirits appear- they are in ritualistic garb, each has a bundle of the webbed flux lines in hand, holding tight.  One spirit speaks to him and tells him that the sipapu was where his people stepped into all four corners of the world from Eden after Adam's disobedience made them exiles and cursed. God also cursed Eden and banished it to an abyss no longer of this world, and charged seven elders of the ancient people with sealing the sipapu so that nothing could come in or go out for eternity. But one of the elders' spirit was gone, and the spirit charges Perci with following the path laid before him in order to find out what happened and prevent other elders from disappearing. He wakes up and guides Mari to the cave, telling her about a new line that he can't break like the others, and that they must follow it deeper into the cave, Mari balks at the idea of following a path, and she heads back to Mexico, but Perci follows, and is surprised to see the new line shift with Mari.\n\nKeys is in a hospital bed, with a mad scientist doctor working on him- he ends up resurrecting Keys from the dead and pumps him full of a serum that keeps his body alive and from decaying, while also enhancing his strength. It turns out he is in Salazar investments. Ana Mercedes meets him and she tells him that his family is safe but thinks he's dead, and she is now his man to do what she commands. He tries to fight her, but another serum is shot into him that compels him to obey. He follows Ana Mercedes into a dim lit room surrounded by windowed compartments, each with representatives from different cartels and goverment agencies. Ana Mercedes is an arms dealer on the black market, and the serums that resurrected, powered, and compel Keys are her weapons.\n\nMari and Perci are weeks removed from their last smuggling run and they go meet their contact for a new job- when they arrive, the contact tells them they are to deliver drugs, when Mari resists, the contact injects Perci with a detonating device that he'll activate unless Mari does what she is told.\n\nEnd of Volume 1 of \"Frontera\"\n\nIf anyone can take that and make a legit comic or has suggestions for what I should do, let me know!\n\n\n",

            "selftext": "i invented a card game named \"Court the Queens\" or \"Angry Kings\" I'd like someone to try playing it and give some feedback\n\nCOURT THE QUEEN / ANGRY KINGS \nObjective of the Game:\n\tWin by collecting the Queen, King, and Jack of the same suit in your Hand\nSetup:\nThe entire deck goes in the middle of the table. Players start without cards.\nGameplay:\nPlayers take turns drawing 1 card from the centre deck and reveal what cards they drew on the table.\n\nDiscard pile will be shuffled back into main deck when there are no more cards left in the main deck\n\nPlayers draw before activating any card effects.\nCard effects are as follows:\n\nAce: On draw you may choose to use the ace and replace any consecutive cards connecting to the ace with new ones from the deck, replaced cards will go into the discard pile. Should you choose not to use the Ace, they will be saved and can then be paired up and discarded to steal a King from the Opponent\n\n2: On draw you must use the 2 to either draw 2 cards or force your opponent to draw 2 cards\n\n5: 5\u2019s may be paired up and discarded to steal the opponent\u2019s 10\n\n6: 6\u2019s may be paired up and discarded to shuffle the discard pile back into the main deck prematurely.\n\n10: 10\u2019s may be used to steal the opponent\u2019s Jack of the same colour. 10\u2019s may not be used when you have a Jack of the same colour and can also be blocked by your opponent using another 10 of the same colour.\n\nJack: Jack\u2019s are able to \u201cCourt The Queen\u201d. You may use one of your Jacks and steal one of your opponent\u2019s Queens of the same colour the two cards are then both discarded\n\nQueen: The Queen protects your hand from Angry Kings. If you have a Queen in your hand, Kings of the same colour will have no effect.\n\nKing: Kings are Angry and they take it out on their kingdom. If a King is in your hand without the presence of a Queen of the same colour your entire hand goes into the discard pile.\nIn your Hand:\nPair up 2 numbers of the same colour and draw that many from the deck, then select two from what you drew and shuffle the rest back into the deck.\n\nOptional Gameplay:\n\nPeace Treaties:\n\t\nJack of all Trades: When all 4 Jacks are in Hand, the player may trade any number of their Jacks for any cards that the opponent controls. The player may only trade for maximum two Face Cards.\n\nCycle sync: When all 4 Queens are in Hand, Queens are twice as hard to court, thus, the opponent must have two Jacks of the same colour to court a single Queen of the same colour. At which point Cycle sync is no longer in play.\n\nKings Landing: When all 4 Kings are in Hand, the player may choose one King to force upon the opponent.",

This requirement would be just like other requirements: fire sprinklers, fire exits, etc. These are inexpensive devices, so the cost would not be much. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stun_grenade\nIf a shooter or shooters is active, the flash-bangs would be triggered. Everyone would be blinded momentarily. An afterimage will also be visible for a considerable time, impairing the shooter's ability to aim with precision. You can run away visually impaired better than you can shoot visually impaired. Instead of triggering all the flash-bang's at once, they could be triggered sequentially to prolong the effect.

For exemple, \"With who do you go to the cinema tomorrow?\" we could answer \"It's just Me, Myself and I\" from Me Myself and I from G-Eazy. Or, \"Did you know that your ex is with him now?\", possible answer : \"So what?\" from P!nk.\nTo search for the extract, it would be the same principle that is for gifs on Facebook Messenger, with key words. The users could also add extracts themselves.\n\nThis function could allow users to share their feelings with their friends with the help of their favorite musics.\nOf course, there is the copyright issue because I don't know if you need to buy the rights for a music if the extract is short.",

There would be no menus, all meals would be improvised with available ingredients, and customers, though having to pay full price at first, would be given a full refund if they managed to fully finish their meal, as this would show that the food wasn't bad enough.

            "selftext": "Every time elections come around I have this idea pop into my mind.  I'm glad I found this sub so that I can share this idea.  Let's see how this works.\n\nI would love to have an app that helps people decide who to vote for.  Here are some thoughts I have on how it would work.  \n\nFirst and foremost, the app should be set up as a kind of game.  For example, a points system for completing actions, achievements for milestone, awards/badges for recognition and whatnot.  \n\nNext, in one way or another, all legislation that is proposed in any way (federal, state, local, etc) would be collected.  It could be categorized relative to each users influence area (citizenship, state, zip code, etc).  Each user would be able to cast their vote for each piece of legislation.  Since this portion of the app is somewhat fixed or consistent, it could tied to a users profile.  Un-voted legislation would show up as open in a profile and closed once voted for.  This could work as a % complete for achievement purposes.  Users should be able to change their vote and the app should track this change.  A calculation could be created relative to changed votes that could provide a reliability/consistency score.\n\nThe next area would be much more 'open'.  Users would be able to submit questions on topics that are important to them or related to current events.  For example, the current Orlando shootings.  The catch is, the subject must be written as a yes/no question.  These questions could be sorted/filtered according to your influence area, popularity, new-ness, etc.  This section could be points based relative to your activity.  Kind of like your karma here on reddit.\n\nNext is 'public accounts' would be included for all leaders and legislators.  These accounts would be set up in such a way as to only record data relative to voted on legislation.  They would be controlled by the app so that vote data could not be manipulated.  If a public official creates a user account, their public account could be attached to their user account and it would filter out voting data from the user account that is controlled by the public account.  Basically, they would not have the option to vote for something in their user account that they actually cast a real vote for in their public account.  On a side note, un-elected candidates would be treated like just a regular user account until they are elected and a public account is created for them.\n\nLastly, analysis.  Using your data and the data of public officials you could create a report of the officials that you most align with.  In the event you align closely with multiple you could use the reliability score to help you decide.\n\nAll in all, I want an app that aggregates legislation data and current events down to yes/no responses that a user can cast their vote on.  Then with the use of, at least, public record (real votes) but hopefully active public users you can find candidates to vote for who truly align with your values.\n\nYes, I have thought a lot about this.  :)  Yes, there is probably a bunch of stuff I have not thought of.  If you are reading this, thank you for getting this far and I hope that this idea sounds as good to you as it does in my head!\n\nEdit/add:  As it relates to new legislation that has not been publicly voted on, user response could help to influence an official's vote to be in line with a majority of their constituents.

You could easily just click Yes even if you didn't do it. However I feel that the people who know they would just hit yes like that wouldn't even download the app, or use it twice and forget it. The long time users would be ones that know that punishment can be beneficial to success, and would answer honestly. The worse that would happen is giving some money to research, poor children, wikipedia ect.\n\nTheres even some avenues to explore for a no-cheat system, like you bet with your buddy that you're going to work out, and if he doesn't show then they can authorize the \"No\".

While this is fine, good practice on CSS, this can effectively eliminate one more subreddit domain, with practically no one bothering to check it outside of curiosity. \n\nThe idea is simple: Create a unique subreddit- \"Usub\" if you will- for every redditor. There would be no domain, it would simply be found first thing when you viewed a redditor's page. \n\nA few features that would further this idea-\n\n* Users could edit their \"Usubreddit\" page CSS, which would allow them to customize their personal \"Overview\" page.\n\n* Instead of subscribing to the \"Usubreddit\", you'd have a \"Friend\" button in place. Whenever you \"Friend\" someone's user sub, you receive all posts made to that sub under a new Friend Feed tab, next to the random button on the top. It'd work similar to a facebook wall, but with HOT content being filtered. \n\n* Users could sticky posts to their own Usub, letting them create a post such as \"About me\" and sticky it to the top. \n\n* Gold could unlock more features to this, such as showing your Snoo avatar at the top instead of the default.\n\n* Users could moderate what content people post onto their Usub- this'd be a necessary feature.\n\n\n**I realize people don't want to see reddit become yet another social media platform- but others DO!

            "selftext": "I've had this idea for awhile for a dating site. The front page would offer a few categories, such as Interests, Values, Personality, Appearance. If you clicked on one, you'd get sub categories, for example Values would drill down into Religion, Politics, Philosophy, and Ethics, and Interests might drill down into Sports, Media, and Making Stuff, and then under Media you'd get Music, Movies, TV, Video Games, Theater, News, and then under Music you'd get Rock, Country, Metal etc. Basically the whole thing would be structured like a search tree in computing. Most levels would have questions to answer and more categories. Some levels would have little message boards on them. The upper levels would be somewhat controlled for neutrality, but the lower levels could be added to by users, so there would essentially be no bottom.\n\nAt any point in the process, you could cut off a branch of the tree by clicking the 'I don't care about this' icon. You could get the pruned branches back later if you wanted. If you tried pruning all the branches, you'd get invited to a special forum called 'Smartasses'. Appearance and Personality would divide the screen into two sections, 'Self' and 'Partner'; Values and Interests would assume you wanted someone like yourself.\n\nThe idea is that you would get matched with people who prioritized the same things as you. There would be an endless amount of questions to answer, like on OKCupid, but organized in such a way that you could actually answer the ones that you cared about and discuss them with other users. Or you could just navigate down to a level you found interesting and have a chat there with other people who liked the same stuff. The forums that would emerge would allow you to see threads for the current level and any level below, so for instance at the Personality level you could see all the threads in Funny Things, Things That Make You Angry, and Running a Household. Users would be encouraged to post original content, for example in Funny Things you could actually post jokes and users could vote on the jokes and get matched with someone who had a similar sense of humor.\n\nI'm a programmer, so I could actually make this site, but whenever I think about how hard it would be to get users I feel discouraged and don't.",

The idea is to catch the worst repeat-offenders.\n\n\nIf that same Honda Civic with the loud exhaust is zooming down your residential street (30 MPH speed limit) at 55 or 60 every evening, it seems like you could turn the photos and information over to law enforcement.\n\n\nThey could either confront the registered owner of the vehicle and suggest he slow down, or they could set up an unmarked unit for enforcement a few random evenings and catch the guy.\n\n\n\nI realize that the device would probably have to cost at least a couple hundred bucks in order for it to be cost-effective to build and market, but I would happily pay that if it meant some of these guys would get stopped.\n\n\nHell, it could save a kid's life.",

            "selftext": "I don't know if this is implemented in the USA or other countries, but in the Netherlands you can make a \"DigiD\", a digital ID. You use this to log in to sites owned by the government to see your information about taxes, education, etc. \n\nWhat if we can link this to your passport or ID-card? You could use it to immediately be registrated, which can be very usefull in (for example) hospitals. There is less time needed for registration, the doctor doesn't have to type in all the details, and there is no chance of incorrect data. This means that, even though the incidence rate is very low, there won't be any fuck-ups because of faulted registration. \n\nIt could also be used by the police. If they write a ticket, they can scan your ID and the ticket will immediately signed to your name. They could also use it to view criminal records and maybe owned cars etc, so they can check if the car someone is driving has been stolen. \n\nI think there could be a lot more applications for this, and we have the technology for it. \n\nThere are of course risks involved with this concept, like the fact that your ID or passport will be a lot more valuable and there needs to be some sort of way to confirm that the person using the ID is actually the owner.\n\nI don't know of any system like this and it would save a lot of time, and could improve accuracy and safety of a lot of information systems.\n\nWhat do you think? Would this be realistic? Can you think of any more useful applications or risks?",

            "selftext": "I've been thinking about the issue of adblockers vs content creation. I use adblocking and have for years. I don't think it's fair to deprive content creators of revenue, but I also will cut out as much advertising and creepy tracking as possible since I know how profoundly powerful it is. It's a choice of lesser of two evils, and I've chose mine.\n\nThinking about how to solve this I think I might be onto something. Imagine a browser extension or an app on your mobile that you can load with any chosen amount of money (either once off or monthly). Then this extension/program tracks (locally) how much time you spend on what content and how deeply you engage with it (spending your life on reddit vs being clickbaited to buzzfeed) and distributes the money proportionally to those creators who's content you consume.\n\nI think it is a powerful idea because:\n\n* It gives the control to the user and allows them to literally vote with their money. Your favourite content creator did something awful? Bring the slider down jut a tad to send the message monetarily.\n\n* It is accessible to anyone. You have $2 a month to spare? It's better than nothing. You have $50? Or $100? How much do you actually value the content you consume? I pay $20ish a month for YouTube Red and Netflix, I would match that for everyone else almost certainly. Voluntary subscriptions and payments work as Patreon and Humble Bundle demonstrate.\n\n* No matter how little you choose to spend, or how small their poportion of your budget is, content creators are looking at audience of millions.\n\n* It is easy to implement. A skilled programmer (which I'm not) could write this software in couple hours using Bitcoin as the payment system and content creators could literally just embed their BTC address in page headers. Done! Of course, I think there should alternatives like using credit cards (cause Bitcoin is scary and magical for laypeople) but that now requires a website, and payment processing, and refunds and all kinds of drama. But you could do that and fund yourself with fee for service sort of thing.\n\nWhat do you think? Am I missing an obvious downside for such a model?",

            "selftext": "So I've developed an interesting idea on what the \"conscious\" is, but I took unproven ideas as part of my theory, the total sum of which results in a \"conscious immortality\". In short, the \"conscious\" is a fourth dimensional entity, picking at pieces of a three dimensional multiverse.\n\nThis will be a bit lengthy, but please bear with me...\n\nThe idea of the multiverse is that there are an uncountable infinite number of universes, where everything can pretty much be the same, but slightly different. One molecule of water could trade places with another in the perspective from one universe to another, while keeping everything else the same. There could also be a universe where the earth never came into being. These ideas must be true for my theory to work.\n\n\"Conscious immortality\" is kind of a funny idea. It states that our consciousness will make us generally immortal. The idea places our consciousness in an area outside the multiverse, and, when you would die in one universe, moves itself to an alternate universe (or reality) where the event happens, but instead of dying, you live through the event. With there being an infinite number of universes, you could have another identical to the point of your death, but branching off without you dying in this alternate universe.\n\nThe \"Mandela effect\" could possibly support my ideas. The effect centering around Nelson Mandela. A relatively small number of people can recall with near 100% certainty that he died in prison in the 1980's, but the general population knows he did not. A seemingly crazy notion is that these people have, in a sense, slipped through the cracks, from an alternate universe where Mandela did actually die in prison, and have somehow ended up in a universe where he did not. \n\nMy thoughts, in regards to the idea of conscious immortality, is that their consciousness just had a slip up, or a continuity error, where they were accidentally placed in a universe where an event that happened in a previous universe did not happen in their new reality. Under this idea, these effects could happen all the time, but with minor things, such as a water molecule trading places, that aren't particularly noticeable.\n\nAll of these ideas would lead to the conclusion that the consciousness is a fourth dimensional entity, having access to the entirety of the infinite multiverse. This concept was a little hard for me to comprehend at first, but to wrap my mind around it, I broke it down into lesser dimensions. A one dimensional line could be placed in a two dimensional entity (a square) with an infinite number of placements. The square into a cube, a cube into a hypercube. Determining this, the consciousness, as a fourth dimensional entity, could contain all of the infinite three dimensional multiverse, encompassing all possibilities.\n\nThis is where I am stumped. The four dimensional entity has all the infinite three dimensional possibilities, but how would it pick and choose how to weave them together. It couldn't be for the comfort of the three dimensional being. What does a human care if a drawing of a barn is comfortable? And then I had a somewhat depressing thought, why would a four dimensional entity even bother with the third dimension?\n\nThanks for reading. Feel free to comment.",

Then you connect your reddit acc.

If you comment, it will give small credits for every upvote your comment receives.\n\nThis is a product that everyone that wants to manipulate us will want to use! They will pay for this company to provide them upvotes and good publicity.\n\nFor example:\n\nCoca Cola wants to get some almost unrelated picture of happy kitties jumping on a table that has bottles of Coke, and make it into frontpage of /r/all. So they post it on r/aww, and contract this company for their services, paying 10 thousand dollars.\n\nThe company then select a bunch of active and real accounts (cause you know, you don't want to break reddit's golden rules...) and show them this post. People will receive 50\u00a2 if they upvote. And 5\u00a2 per upvote they receive if they post a good comment (more if they hit the top comment). Sooner the post will have 4k upvotes, with awesome comments and coca cola wll be fizzling happily as shit.\n\nThe company can take 60% to themselves, the community will receive 40% and we will continue to be the stupid redditors we already are.",

Rather than feeling that you have to disciplined yourself to eat better, we believe that you can train your mind to view certain foods in such a negative way that even the smell of them can cause an unpleasant sensation. \n\n\u00a0\n\nThe product works in the following way:\n\n\u00a0\n\nStep 1: Set your goal\nText us the food habit that you want to eliminate. It could be as simple as: \u201cI want to stop eating donuts\u201d. \n\n\u00a0\n\nStep 2: Identify the routine \nDuring the first days, text us every time you eat the unhealthy food. We\u2019ll use this information to text you facts about how the unhealthy food is affecting your body around the time you crave for that food.\n\n\u00a0\n\nStep 3: Associate negative stimulus with the food\nSmell the \u201cNegative\u201d scent every time you eat the unhealthy food. \n\n\u00a0\n\nStep 4: Choose a healthier option \nWhenever you crave for the unhealthy food, visualise how it affects your body and replace it with a healthier option. After eating healthy, smell the \u201cPositive\u2019 scent to feel rewarded. \n\n\u00a0\n\nWe are really interested to receive feedback and suggestions to know if you would be interested in our product.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThanks for help us.",

However, it cost $200,000 and it only flies for 30 minutes max. I want to build a drone that cost $70,000 and uses a hybrid Gas-electric engine. This engine didn't exist until now; there's a German company named Yeair! that has developed a hybrid gasoline electric propeller engine. I did a build out of the cost of the aircraft and it is really cheap to make, the high costs are just associated with R&D.\n\nI'm thinking about starting an Indiegogo crowd funding launch to raise money for my idea. I've already created a CAD sketch of it and started a company Talos Aviation Inc. But I'm afraid to make it a reality because I've got mixed feedback. \n\nI've gotten a lot of push back about how the FAA will react to an Automated drone w/ a person in it. Should I make it non-automated but make automation available for landing/takeoff like how planes have autopilot in planes today? \n\nJust trying to get people's thoughts on whether of not I should go for it?

I know that I'm not the only one who hates having to mess with default audio outputs for multiple monitor setups, speaker setups, headphones, etc.  Currently, Windows has quite the sucky system for managing audio.  It'll show you your devices and allow you to set one as the default for all audio, and setting specific programs to different devices is non-intuitive.  So, a simple proposal would be taking an approach not unlike what Classic Shell did with their amazing program, and create a new audio manager GUI that allows one to easily set programs to different audio outputs, make audio automatically switch when a program is moved into a different monitor space, and even more (if someone could add on to this, beautiful).  I would personally pay for a program that had these features, yet not a single one exists at the moment.",

We came up with the following ideas:\n\n1. Access Control (Multibiometric unit)\n\nSoftware that combines fingerprint, iris, voice scanners, cameras in one unit for robust person identification. Enabled notifications to mobile devices, cloud storage, online 24/7 access every single activity with software. \n\n2. Facial search engine\n\n  Imagine, that you have huge video or folder with big number of photos. Wouldn't it be great to search any person without looking for all amount of data. \nFor example, a service where you just put link to video and target persons you want to find. As output you'll get timecodes for every photo that indicates time of person entry in video.\n\n3. Facial behaviour analysis\n\nIdea is similar to [demo](http://www.affectiva.com/), but with automatic age, gender, ethnithity estimation  and with connection to social networks. \n\nIf you want more visual information for those ideas go [here](http://everycoder.blogspot.com/2016/06/startup-adventures-what-do-we-offer-to.html)\n\nThank you for your time) \n\n",

Define who manages the vote and who pays for the election.  Define how timetables work, and how percentages of voting determine outcome.  Define procedures for international recognition.\n\nJust as a starting-point, given the sway of popular opinion, should a single vote be enough to mandate succession?  Are there cases when a single vote is not sufficient?  If a single vote is not sufficient, how much time must pass before another vote is scheduled?  What percentages would trigger how many rounds of voting?  If a subsequent round of voting fails after previous rounds had succeeded, what happens next?\n\nBasically the point would be to moderate any fickle fads or trends, and to establish that yes, the people really do want to make this fundamental change.\n\nIn properly managed elections where honest results were obtained, I would propose that if 80% of the population voted to secede that only a single round of voting would be necessary.  If more than 65% vote to secede but not 80%, then at least two rounds of voting would be necessary, spaced over three years.  If less than 65% but more than 55% vote to secede then three rounds of voting over six years, at three year intervals would be necessary.  If less than 55% vote to secede then four rounds of voting over twelve years at three year intervals would be necessary.\n\nSure, as described this procedure where only slight majorities might want something is onerous, but that's the difference between a population that has a supermajority wanting a change and a small majority that may wane wanting a change.",

There is no prime minister, why would you buy into 1 person? They're not going to solve everything, they're not going to be good at everything. Instead of voting for 1 prime minister/president, why not vote for people in individual areas. For example, a vote for someone who oversees public health, education, the environment etc.\n\nPeople will only be allowed to vote for individual areas which they have sufficient knowledge in. While many would be angry about this, it would prevent ignorant people for voting on things they have no knowledge about. How can we expect normal people to vote for important things like climate change or overpopulation? Most people today seem just worried about money and themselves when voting.\n\nTests or education results should be used to determine who can vote for what. Obviously the current education system wouldn't be perfect for this, we would have to make changes in this area.\n\nThis is just an idea, I've had it for a long time and wanted to get other people's opinions on it.",

            "selftext": "So everyone complains that making new friends is significantly harder after college, I would even say it's super hard *during* college but that's just me. Since it's difficult to engineer real life interaction, I think a social media app would work really well! \n\nMost of us spend a lot of time on our phones, so we could use this time productively to enrich our social lives. Plus, this would cut to the chase and only connect you with people who want to broaden their social circle. Maybe you could indicate whether you are up to \"just meet new people\", or \"finding an everlasting best-friendship\". IRL I find a lot of adults are not interested in making further connections because usually they have a solid network in place, so they find they don't have the time to pursue new relationships. So you can try your hardest to pursue that interaction with them, you'll find the door is closed in a lot of cases. I'm not sure I'm expressing myself well, sorry :/\n\nI was thinking of something based on Tinder. I think the link to Facebook could be positive in that you may realize you have friends in common and that could inform you as to what type of person they are. I don't like the reliance on pictures though, this aspect could be kept for security reasons, but we could find a way to make the actual profile stand out a bit more..",

            "selftext": "Hello everyone out there,\nthe following is an idea I had 10 Minutes ago, and I think it's so positive so that everyone has to know about it. Maybe someone cares, I would love that.\n\n\n**Iders - A social advanced vision**\n\n\nNow that I study since a year at a university, and watched a lot of TED Talks in the last weeks, a thought came again to my mind I already had a long time ago.\n\n\nDo you know what drives me nuts when I think about Humanity, Education, Science, Technology and all those things? What would the world look like if **everyone** on earth had the chance to study? I imagine that if this would be true, our scientific knowledge would be ahead of the one nowadays. Think of all the smart, sometimes extraordinary people that **don't** study something they are potentially interested in.\nAnd now, think of how it would be if everyone could work on anyone else's idea because it fits their interests without needs to be part of a company, a university or something else.\n\n\nWell, that's *exactly* what my vision is about.\n\nI call it Idea Thrivers - short name \"Iders\" (**Id**ea Thriv**ers**, \"Ider\" on singular).\n\n\nIders is a agglomeration of ideas, gathered on a platform (an application, a website, a public institution present in every town, these three combined, whatever) and driven by the people how have any kind of ideas.\nEverybody can join an idea, work on it and contribute to it, doesn't matter wether you work from home (maybe in another country) or together in offices, laboratories, caf\u00e9s or elsewhere: The Internet makes it possible.\n\nAlso in the future the are no patented or licensed technologies, and all resources for building something are available to the public. Every (completed) idea is free to experimentation and refinerie.\n\n\nAs you maybe can imagine, there is no space for competition for money in this future. In this future, it's all about Progress and a better future for man kind.\n\nSo, to reach that, we need to ban money, or we need to disengage your personal money income from your work (a unconditional basic income). My favourite is the first one, it helps to eliminate the desire of having a lot of money.\n\n\nOf course, not everyone will work on ideas. There will be normal jobs like nowadays, but with the difference that you do them because you enjoy it instead of earning money with them.\nAs we arrived in the age of Digitalization, in the future we probably could \"outsource\" a lot of jobs to robots which will reduce the amount of human labour.\n\n\n\nMy point is:\nIf *everyone* has the chance of doing what he loves instead of doing something in the need of earning money, we can focus a much larger amount of our minds on ideas which probably leads to an unimaginable progress in science, technology, and last but not least society. Isn't this a desirable vision of the future?",

It might sound ridiculous now, but for young kids especially, the social pressure of appearing vulnerable and ignorant will keep many kids from asking questions.\n\nBy anonymously pinging the teacher, the teacher will know that they need to slow down and maybe explain things in a different way. \n\nAnd just having one student express their confusion would make other students more comfortable in admitting their's as well.\n\n**2) It disturbs the teacher's rhythm.** \n\nThey are trying to lecture and get through a point, but they lose their train of thought when they see a hand stick up in the air. Often times, they are about to wrap up an idea that would have answered the question, but now they have to awkwardly stumble and ignore the question while the finish their thought.\n\nIf they just get a vibration notification to their phone, that can remind them to return to this point and let them know that someone is confused.\n\n**How would it work?**\n\nThere could be buttons like the [Amazon Internet of Things customizable Dash button](https://aws.amazon.com/iot/button/), that are connected to an app on the teacher's phone. When someone presses a button, the phone will vibrate and it will show which student/desk it came from.\n\n---\n\nSo what do you think about this idea? \n\n(I know there are a lot of kinks to work out but I think the basic premise has some potential)",

            "selftext": "I saw [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgyqAD5Z6_A) segment from John Oliver about doping among athletes.\n\nAnd it made me think: Why not just have a separate Olympics level event where doping is allowed if not encouraged?\n\nThere are downsides to allowing doping, as covered by John Oliver, such as:\n\n1) Posing a danger to athlete bodies. Someone could trash their body if not outright die from taking too many drugs.\n\n2) Ruining the integrity of a sport.\n\nBut here's the thing, we already have another category of sport where athletes face danger to life and limb: Motorsports. \n\nDrivers could die in a fireball, or get severe and lifelong crippling injuries. Yet millions of fans still turn up every year to watch Formula 1, 24 Heures du Mans, IMSA, NHRA, etc. etc. Clearly danger to athletes don't really matter in the big picture of things.\n\nAs for the integrity of a sport, if the rules clearly allow doping, then doping poses no danger to its integrity anyway.\n\nSo why would someone care about a pro-doping sport? Well, besides the reasons fans already watch events like the Olympics, we will be adding:\n\n**Technology**: Just like motorsports, where many technologies like safety belts, windshield wipers, supercapacitor hybrids, etc. are tested to their limits in competition, a pro-doping sport could allow pharmaceutical companies to gain an interest in developing extremely high-quality and reliable drugs. Imagine if say, 5 Hour Energy had a label that said \"Winner of <pro-doping sport name>\". Biotech companies could start looking into safe and reliable assistance technologies too, pushing cybernetic technology forward (although cybernetic assisted athletes will have to compete in a different class from just meatbag athletes).\n\n**Drama/Excitement**: 70+ million people call themselves NASCAR fans, and a large proportion of them claim the crashes are part of the charm. Athletes dropping dead on the field from drug overdose would up the ante a little, as now besides their training, they also have to ride the ragged edge between enhanced performance and death/life as a cripple. Fans would also get more drama out of it, as their favorite athlete \"crashes\". It would certainly make for a more entertaining event, since the current Olympics struggles to sell tickets. \n\n**Money**: Because athletes now have to take expensive drugs to stay competitive, we open the doors to sponsorship. Yes, this does bring with it downsides, like in Formula 1 where Ferrari dominated for a long time in large part for sheer budgetary reasons. However, it also brings with funding for athletes themselves. As it stands, Olympic athletes cannot be professionals. That means serious sacrifices on their part just to stay in the competition. Sponsorship funding reduce if not eliminate these barriers, allowing them to focus 100% on their craft, which leads to even better performance.\n\nOverall, imagine this: You get to watch runners run at superhuman speed, and fencers fence with unbelievable precision.",

            "selftext": "Wouldn't it be great if you could listen to articles instead of just read them? I have so little time in my daily doings to read now. I wish I had the time but I simply don't. Podcasts and audiobooks are amazing but I want to be able to listen to the latest news from TechCrunch, what exactly the brexit was  about from various news outlets, and the latest blog post from Mr Money Mustache. \n\nIf content publishers wanted to record quick audio files with their print article (or sub it out to Fiverr or something) there could be channels kinda like on snapchat that would queue up and stream automatically for you to listen. It would solve the car problem (there's only so much content you can safely take in while driving a car), save people time and still allow them to connect and enjoy the same relevant up to date media they already do. You could get funky with it and sync the app to your music app so that you have your own radio news, talk, and music station. And of course you could drill down and make it extremely social with links published in each article/episodes info page, comments, sharing, top listens of the day/week/month. And definitely have a link to the actual print/online article for people wanting to see any pictures, graphs, etc. Magazines could get on board with QR codes that could be scanned and then articles are downloaded to the app. I could listen to an entire wired magazine (hopefully without the shit ton of ads they have now) on my way to and from work without ever thumbing a single page. \n\nWhatcha think? Something doable?",

I currently use ctrl+w to close a tab, but it would be nice if I could just use my setup's extra functions to close it, like on a macbook a three finger swipe to the right (goes back a page), or the extra buttons on a mouse (My mouse wheel tilts to the left or right, to go back or forward a page respectively), or the extra buttons on a graphics tablet.\n\n\nThe idea is this: when you open a new tab, chrome's back button is grayed out. That is wasted real estate! I suggest a UX improvement: changing that button (and all relevant event listeners) to close the tab/page, when there is no page to go back to. If you click a link and it opens a page within the tab, then the back button does the normal functionality. Then I could use my handy-dandy mouse to close tabs with just a flick of my finger!",

Inevitably, though, the DJ plays one of those choreographed dance songs and awkwardness ensues.  That one crazy aunt only sort-of remembers the Electric Slide and ends up running into people.  The Running Man Challenge only has one participant.  There isn't enough time to teach everyone how to Dougie.\n\nThe problem is that it's difficult to keep up with all the latest dances (and to remember the classics.)  It'd be great if there was some page that tracked the ones that are likely to be encountered at an upcoming wedding or school dance and could point to YouTube videos (or equivalent) that teach them.  I'm not sure what the best format is - a webpage would obviously work, but maybe a YouTube channel might be better?  Or a subreddit where upvotes could be used to prioritize the must-know dances?  Thoughts?\n\nSuch a page could be linked to from wedding websites so that attendees show up with more dance skills.  Imagine how much more fun dances could be if people actually knew how to dance!\n\nNegative feedback is appreciated as well - maybe something like this already exists?  Maybe we don't want Nanna doing the Stanky Legg?",

            "selftext": "So last night I had a dream in which a group of friends and I went and played this game. I have not come up with a name for it at this point, but it sounds super fun. You go in with a group of people and you're trying to run away from this monster assassin sort of thing. Thing is - your actions are secretly being monitored. You can throw your teammates under the bus, for instance - if you tell the assassin where another teammate is, he might spare you. You can also supply him with ammo (nerf) and other items to keep yourself alive. There is a \"police station\". You go here to check in periodically throughout the game. You may write any \"evidence\" here. \n\nAt the end of the game, a \"detective\" goes over the events of the game with everyone and points out what everyone did that was good and bad. Until this point, no one knows who was monitoring them (the detective is picked at the beginning of the game secretly). If you were helpful to teammates and skillful at distracting/hiding from the assassin, you get more points and are more likely to win. However, if you helped the assassin or threw teammates under the bus, you were considered an accomplice and lost points. \n\nEveryone starts at 100 pts. Each death subtracts 10 pts. Other actions are determined by the detective (I will come up with a better points system). At the end of the \"evidence\" phase, everyone gets a chance to appeal to the detective, telling their side of the story. If someone tells a rather compelling story, they may be awarded more points. At the end of this phase, whoever has the most points wins. I thought it sounded really fun.\n\nI think this was inspired by a game we used to play with my youth group called Contraband, where you had to find glow sticks without being caught by the \"soldiers\".",

            "selftext": "    Hello, Reddit community. I'm kind of new here because I was looking for a place to tell about my ideas and \n\ninventions. I think this is the perfect place because it's a place where the environment isn't so harsh. I'm not a \n\ncomputer engineer, but when I get to college, that is the degree I am pursuing. Right now I am just a hobbyist. \n\nSo, now that we are \"introduced\", I shall begin my idea.\n\n\n     Steve Jobs has said everybody should learn how to program a computer because it teaches you how to think. \n\nI'm not from California, and I'm not a college dropout, I'm still in high school. I'm just a kid who enjoys \n\nprogramming and circuit building. However, I am currently in the process of building a binary computer. For those \n\nwho don't know, Binary is a base-two number system consisting of 1's and 0's where individual digits are bits and a \n\nfull ascii character such as a letter is a byte or 8 digits. I won't post how all of binary works, I'll just post it in \n\nanother Subreddit dedicated to such a matter. Anyway, I'm working on a computer that displays and \n\ncommunicates in Binary from using its keyboard to displaying numbers and letters in Binary. My first design will \n\nonly display a nibble or half-byte. It will look like the first Macintosh and will have a fold-out keyboard that you pull \n\nout the front and push back in when not in use. Its hardware is meant to be modified is so desired and it will have \n\na port. It will run off 9 volts and will be able to link up with other computers like it to send data as well as other info.  \n\nI am also implementing Atari joystick compatibility . I will create modules you can add on and I hope to create a \n\ncommunity that will build a module library. I am also working on affordability so everyone can get access to \n\ncomputing. In terms of hardware, I am using transistors and will use logic gates. My goal is to make it for \n\nprogrammers to create programs. LED's will be the display. Switches or pushbuttons will be on the keyboard. The \n\nhardware will be connected via jumper wires and breadboards. Capacitors are going to be used for memory, \n\nbasically ram. It will only store, at max, bytes. All of the computer is pure circuitry, except any addon modules like \n\nthe Atari joystick. I hope you will all follow me on this computer journey and give me input, and hell, inspire you to \n\nbuild your own computers, because I am actually building mine and I will give photos and updates. Thank You.\n",
