Each player in turn says a simple noun (one word), that makes a compound noun with the previous player's word. A typical round might look like this:\n\n\"Match\" \"Box\" \"Pill\" \"Bug\"...\n\nAnyone who doesn't say a word in [arbitrary time limit] gets a point.\n\n**Challenges:** If a player says something that doesn't make sense as a compound noun, or that isn't a word in itself- Eg. Player 1: \"Hat\", Player 2: \"...Pig\" or Player 1:\"Hat Player 2:\"...Cat in the\", other players may 'challenge' their word. In which case they would then have 45 seconds to draw the offending spurious (compound)noun. In the examples given; Player 2, if challenged, would have 45 seconds to draw either a hatpig or pighat and a 'cat in the' (whatever that might be) respectively. The remaining players then vote as to whether this is a bona fide 'hatpig' or whatever: if over half vote against, the player gets a point.\n\n**'Fish!':** Sometimes you can't think of anything to say- say, the guy before you just said \"tractor\"- and you don't want to just say \"pig\", and struggle for the next 45 seconds drawing a 'tractor pig'- you can call \"Fish!\" and drag someone else down with you. In this case you get to pick another player, and you each have 30 seconds to draw either a fish tractor or a tractor fish. Your drawings then go to a vote- the player with the least votes gets a point.\n\n**Winning:** In case it's not already obvious, least points wins.\n",

So my idea is like a [MARS turnbine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airborne_wind_turbine), but underwater. So a it would be a football shape and the size matters on how powerful you need. And you just throw it in the sea, and it'll slowly charge up. It wouldn't be practical in most spots, but where it is it would be extremely useful. So lets say you're going sailing, or fishing, this could really conserve gas, or be the only power for rural parts of the developing world (like tebit, india, ect) And like most renewable energy it would have to charge a battery. So what are your ideas? does this idea exist already?\n\nAlso, if it were practical enough, you could use it on a large scale in the ocean (low cost of installment and materials) \n\nMy estimated cost of making about 20 dollars large scale (old car parts, with custom turbine) without the battery",

It would have to be fast to be practical, and far cheaper to make to make any sense. \n\nImagine a future where a $25 piece of equipment could print stuff using any old pensil/pen. The changes to the world would be drastic. Africa and the rest of the developing world would improve. Remote/Isolated villages could finally type. Also it would probably be used for printing many of the same thing. Also #3 pensil would be the best pensil because it stays the sharpest. \n\nSo /r/Lightbulb What do you thing? What are the flaws?

I am definitely open to hearing any opinion or feedback (good or bad). \n\nNow i am just trying to think with an open mind so please dont hate me for that\n\nBut i think our school system would improve so much if we changed some things. \n\n1. The Parent(s)/Guardian(s) of a student enrolled in a school system must show up and attend a full 24 hours of school with said student, per school year. That is only 3 full days of school in most places. The Parent/Guardian(s), will attend all classes with their student, BUT NOT INTERFERE. They are there:\n\n-to make sure the student attends class\n-pick up a personal report from the teacher about their student\n-Meet the teacher\n-Watch the classroom and other students and understand the student's environment, the students classmates, and what the student is really learning and how.\n-Also, it's nice to brush up on stuff you forgot you had learned before, thus, making both parents and students smarter, if not just a little bit a day.\n\nNow think about it. How many kids do you know are gonna act up in class with their parent/guardian there? How many kids do you know are gonna act up with a friend's parent their, or even a complete stranger? It just really helps the teacher keep class attention. If you know a student who acts bad in school and who you are sure will act bad even with their parent their, then what is keeping them from acting bad now? Wouldnt this be better for that kid? Or that kid could be removed from the class.\n\nNow I also think there should be double the amount of teachers. At least 2 teachers per 30 students. One teacher teaches, while one helps others who didnt quite catch on as fast or for whatever reason, fell behind, catch up. This assistant teacher will also help with parents. Now having two teachers is way better for this particular reason... less private teacher/student relations. Teachers won't have as much of a chance to develop that private relationship so less sex scandals and such. Less teachers touching students. Teachers now watch each other. \n\nNow doubling up on teachers also improves our students safety, without a doubt. I hate to talk about it, but in the case of more school shootings, more teachers, the better. \n\nNow i do have a list of concerns that Im pretty sure you might have thought of while reading this.\n\n-(Q)-What if the parent causes a problem, brings a weapon, or does something else crazy? (A) Schools should have a security guard team or better security with metal detectors. All parents/teachers should have to go through these metal detectors. Also, teachers will be able to call security to their class room if they need them for anything. \n\nI also think this education system can greatly help the economy by providing more and more jobs. Schools will make more money doing this from school lunches and more school supplies and such. More jobs for security and teachers (who should also receive some kind of raise, if not a big one). \n\nBetter attendance in school as well as a connection to home and a relationship with the parents will definitely increase grades, class room performance, and will lower the drop out rate. \n",

            "selftext": "A consciocractic government would be a system of direct democracy that gathers votes from those with a certain level of education and above.\n\nThe education would involve:\n\n* How the government works\n* An overview of world history, as well as the nation's history\n* The scientific process (and an overview of a few scientific fields)\n* Basic logic and reasoning\n* and perhaps some electives.\n\nA great system of education would be needed, but I am having trouble finding a way to make it \"corruption-resistant\". I'd love to have the government fund education, but if education is the path towards voting eligibility... how do you prevent corruption in what is taught? \n\nIn addition to this voting process, a majority of the legislation process would be determined by case-studies alone. If a law is proposed, legislators must come with substantial evidence that it is for the betterment of the nation's people as a whole. Without evidence, the new laws may be tested in select areas of the nation (similar to states) to determine its effectiveness. A kind of \"may the best law win\" process.\n\nNot sure if this concept has been discussed with another name, but if not I'm calling it a Consciocractic government. From latin *consio* meaning \"know\" and of course the Greek *cratic* meaning \"rule\".\n\nAny discussion on the idea would be appreciated! I'd love help to flesh out the concept, I'm planning on using it in a fictional world :)",

            "selftext": "Where \"Fully-immersed VR\" means you can not only see and hear, but also smell and touch and taste things, and you move your limbs by (thinking that you're) actually moving your limbs.\n\nI'm aware that this is practically science fiction with today's neuroscience. However, to me, it seems that this is something that may be possible in the future.\n\nAnyways, I think that fully-immersed VR would be best handled by taking advantage of the function of dreaming. After all, a dream is essentially automatically-occurring VR anyways. You can usually touch and smell and taste in a dream.\n\nUsing dreams also erases the problem with movement in the VR. You couldn't normally walk within the VR without eventually bumping into the wall. However, obviously, you don't move your legs in real life when you walk in a dream.\n\nOf course, it wouldn't actually be a dream, simply using the mind's built-in framework for a dream. You'd probably have to be asleep, but the part of your brain that makes you question things (which isn't active when you're dreaming, unless you're having a lucid dream) would still have to work. And, obviously, the images conjured up by the mind in the dream would be controlled.\n\nSo that's my suggestion on how VR could work, in the distant future. How do you find it? Am I completely wrong in my assessment of oneirology?",

It would be similar to the Previous Channel button, but when a really loud part on a movie comes up and your friends/family are sleeping, you just tap it and the volume goes to the previous (Most likely quieter) volume instantly.\n\nFor example, watching Lord of the Rings, the dialogue is fairly soft, but the action scenes and battles can be absurdly loud with the combined musical scores.

It seems to me that traditional hearing aids are entirely the wrong way to fix hearing loss.  Why use the sense that is damaged?  And of course, for people with severe hearing loss, a hearing aid won't even work.\n\nMeanwhile, our visual field contains a ridiculous amount of information, and we typically only pay attention to a small part of it.  So how about a visual representation of sound instead?  It could be as simple as an oscilloscope, but presumably a better system can be created that focuses on differentiating sounds used in human language.  Of course, it's a big assumption that people can learn to discern different sounds using the visual system, but it shouldn't be any more difficult than lip-reading, which many deaf people already use.  \n\nNote: I am aware of [these glasses](http://bigthink.com/design-for-good/babelfisk-a-visual-hearing-aid) but speech recognition, even if it works, will fall short in a lot of areas, such as helping the user recognize various tones and other non-speech noises.",

Put a switch somewhere on the keyboard -- perhaps one below each key for thumb-access no matter what your hand position is (each individual switch would still \"strum\" every note you're holding down.) or if you want to go cheaper, just one on the side of the keyboard that you operate with your other hand.

If there's a space just before the nozzle where it actually gets wider, this creates for a \"leeway area\" where it takes longer for it to overflow, so you can re-tighten the cap fast enough for it to actually matter.\n\n....This is an extreme \"first world problem\" solution. It's probably not worth the silly jokes that would come from how ridiculously the bottle is shaped, or the extra plastic since you wouldn't actually fill the leeway area with fluid since that'd defeat the purpose, but it's a fun idea :P",

I've ran into situations where I can't contact them because I had no methods beyond the game, or perhaps we both used a forum but they don't respond to the PMs/emails you send them (perhaps because it's linked to an old, unchecked email address).  Googling turns up no results, you're in the dark.\n\nThe objective of the website is a single spot for people to drop a message and wait for their buddy to find it.\n\n###Sketches of website design:\n\n* Homepage: http://i.imgur.com/yI7mCY5.png\n\n* User page after searching: http://i.imgur.com/5uHiLkP.png\n\nKeeping it super simple.  No registration.  Just search for a name (whether it's yours or the name of the person you're trying to contact) and see their user page.  If you're trying to contact that user, use the box on the right and leave them a message that they can find when they search for themselves.  If you're the person being searched for, search yourself and look at the messages left for you by old friends (and possibly leave a message telling others how to get in contact with you).\n\n=====\n\n###Possible features:\n\n* Sign up for notifications of new posts via email/RSS\n* Filter by game/website (especially useful for common usernames; making a list could be quite the undertaking, though probably better than letting the user fill it in themselves due to typos)\n* More advanced search that shows results for similar names (e.g. you can't exactly remember their username and search \"someusername\", you would get results for \"someusername32\" as well)\n\n=====\n\n###Thoughts/Questions:\n\n* I'm not sure how bad vandalism could become, how best to prevent it and treat it (a flagging system maybe... ugh, that wouldn't be very fun, haha)\n* Should there be a character limit on the posts?  How much would be sufficient (300? 1000? 2000? lower?)\n* Is it a little *too* simple making the UX suffer?\n* There's /r/longlostgamers for those in need in the meantime (I think an individual website would have many benefits, though)\n\nCritique and suggest away :)",

            "selftext": "I've had this idea for a while, and really wished there was a subreddit where I could share it. I'm glad you guys exist...!\n\nI've been playing this WW2 air combat game recently called War Thunder. In it, the most maneuverable planes are the least technologically adept ones, the biplanes. So I thought \"why did the world's airforces move away from them?\", only to learn that air tactics had changed considerably at the time, as well as technology. In a nutshell, the disadvantage of biplanes versus more modern planes is at high speeds, meaning that they sacrifice aerodynamics for stability and control. So obviously they have no place in modern combat. But how about away from it...?\n\nThe mindset behind it isn't anything deep or meaningful. It's just pure awesomeness. The maneuverability of a 1930's biplane combined with the cutting edge engine and aerodynamics technology of today. Think about it. A classic biplane shape, except made of carbon fiber, or a similar high hardness/low weight material. Instead of a primitive <50hp engine, a beastly 500hp+ supercharged engine, running on high-octane fuel*. It would outmaneuver every plane made in history. The only limit would be the pilot's well-being, as high Gs aren't all that healthy.\n\nI wonder what could go wrong... It seems like a flawless idea to me, honestly. :D Any ideas...?\n\n\n\n*I had considered a jet engine, but found out that they perform best at high speeds, which isn't the point of this plane.",

And even secondhand academic textbooks cost an absolute fortune. IT just seems like the market for buyers and sellers of new/secondhand textbooks at uni is really against them.\n\nSo how about this: you go onto a website and you enter your university and what books you want to buy. Then it shows a list of all the people within your uni who are selling the books you want. You either win an \"auction\" or buy it straight away and then you can meet up with them in the uni and collect them.\n\nIt would be especially good for people studying law, english etc because in theory you could sell/buy an entire reading list for your course very easily, without even having to post it. I've been teaching myself HTML and Java for a few months, and while I don't think I'm at the stage where I could develop it now, I want to learn.\n\nIs this a good idea? In theory, in practice?",

Some people end up just leaving them up all year because they are so much work putting them up in the first place.\n\nWhy not have LED \"Christmas lights\" that run through a control box.  This control box would have all major holidays on a circular dial.  St Patricks Day, Valentines Day, Fourth of July, etc.  The user could dial to the correct upcoming holiday and have lights displayed with those colors accordingly.  Beyond that, simple animation would be a breeze as well.  Maybe have another switch for 5 preset animations (blinking, scrolling, etc).\n\nThe user could leave lights up all year, have lights for whatever holidays they want, or turn them off when not in use.\n\nWhat do you guys think?  Pros or cons?  Bad idea, good idea?  Are there any similar items on the market today that I am just not finding?",

You take one out, pop one in your mouth, and suddenly your stomach feels full and it stops hurting.*\n\n\nSo I have an idea for a \"hunger pill\". You know those little tiny square towels that you put in water and they expanding slowly into a large size towel? This is where I'm going.\n\nYou swallow a capsule, some sort of foam expands in your stomach over the course of an hour. This would potentially trick your stomach into thinking that you've actually consumed food until you can find actual food. Of course, this has nutrients and protein in it. \n\nThe foam then either slowly disintegrates OR is able to be broken down by stomach acids. When finally broken down, it would have the same consistency as pudding, making it easy to digest.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Is it even possible?\n",

It will contain a speaker for saying commands, strobe light for it's own defence, mace (I think they call the super intense kind \"black label\") metal BB gun, rubber bullet shooting gun, a tazer and a pistol type of gun for emergencies. I'm picturing it being about 2ft x 2ft x 2ft and that should include the battery (or engine) and all computers and weapons. \nI picture it's primary use would be to defend things during riots and assisting police in riots. It could easily defend historical, and religious sights during mobs. I can see this being relatively cheap and maybe cost about $1500 if produced well. The cons would include having drones on US soil, ability for the government to take over easier and possibilities for abuse. Also if it was ever put in the hands of an AI there could be problems. I'll draw up a sketch later and any commentary would be nice. \nAlso in advance my spelling is crappy.",

It's not necessarily because of apathy, either; there's just a limit to how informed you can be about, say, the pros and cons of funding a new subway system.\n\nSo, how about this: instead of being put to a popular vote, there's a small group of people that are called in, similar to be called to jury duty; it's mandatory, and your employer has to let you take leave in order to do it.  \n\nAs part of this small group, you spend maybe a week hearing the pros and cons from advocates on both sides of the issue; it's similar to opposing lawyers at a trial presenting their case, maybe even with cross-examination by the two sides.  At the weeks end, you're given a chance to discuss what you've heard. Then you vote.  The issue passes or fails depending on whether it receives the majority of the votes.\n\nA decision can be reversed by the general public if a petition for reversal obtains over a certain number of signatures; if this happens, the issue is voted on by the general public.",

Both websites are REALLY strict on posts due to how they can run restaurants out of business (or get professors fired) which is understandable...however, even if it's unfair to skew all the ratings just for one thing you didn't like I think it is worth it to be able to at least say something about it (unfiltered). Sure it's unfair to rate the restaurant one star because of, say, ridiculous valet prices...but that's a legit complaint and if it's a common one it might affect my decision to go there.",

This applies both at home and public toilets. Unfortunately, the seat is often left down, which results in unwanted mess that disadvantages those that need to sit.\n\nThe Solution: Install a soft-spring mechanism that always pushes the seat in the up-position (unless the lid is also down, which the additional weight would keep the seat down as well). This way, if the lid is lifted, the seat also lifts, and a man can do his business cleanly. If a person needs to sit, just push the seat down and sit! This keeps things cleaner for all, not only in the home, but also in public toilets.\n\nThe soft-spring means that the toilet-seat will rise up slowly - it won't flip like a mouse-trap. This already exists for toilet-seats going down so they don't slam.",

It got me thinking is it possible to do this but make the treadmill be interactive with the game. For example, the treadmill would be moving as fast as your character in the game. So if your character was running, the treadmill would move faster than say if you were crawling and/ or walking. Or if you went up a hill maybe the treadmill becomes at an angle equivalent to what your character is trying to walk up.\n\nIf you were in a vehicle, however, the treadmill couldn't be going as fast as the vehicle (because I don't think anyone would walk/ run that fast) so instead if you were in a vehicle the treadmill would start at walking speed and then as you accelerate your vehicle the treadmill accelerates slightly (up to a point). Or if your vehicle has like an after burner or boost that's when the treadmill would go into a full run. \n\nThe only question I have is has this already been done? And would this be a popular idea do you guys think?\n\nTL;DR: Would it be a good idea to combine an interactive treadmill with a Gaming PC",

Even worse if I've locked my computer before remembering to mute, I have to log back in before I can correct the problem.\n\nProbably not worth the added build cost for such a minor convenience.",

            "selftext": "I was thinking of ways to make high school better for future generations. I was thinking about prom and it's general empty, shallow, lameness. So hey, why not replace it with something more exciting and worth yer buck like a zombie survival day!\n\nI graduated from a high school with 1,500+ people, so I thought... Wouldnt it be nice if...?\n\nSo here's how it would work in a high school scenario (it can be upscaled for national, maybe even international thing):\n\n-two teams (zombie vs human duh) two teams play differently, further explanation:\n\nHumans:\n\n-LASER TAG for humans (to kill the zombies with, 'course) or for melee use red powder (like those color festival ones) for outdoor use, and red goop. (Revel at the aftermath of war the next day).\n\n-point system: kills (+50 headshot, +10 limb, etc)\n\n-point system: gathering resources (food +10 can of spam, \"guns\" and \"ammo\" +50, rope you can always use some +80, --fleshlight-- flashlight +30, etc)(labeled with an official sticky note and hidden throughout campus)\n\n-establishing and protecting your base (eg, cafeteria for me personally), keeping it from being overrun (capture the flag style) +15 points every hour your base is not captured \n\n-am I forgetting something?\n\nZombies:\n\n-to balance things while keeping it sorta realistic, zombies can limp-run (if you can manage that) and should be the superior team numbers wise\n\n-kill humans by marking them with good ole goop and powder (POWDER FOR OUTDOORS ONLY)\n\n-try to overrun humans base +15 every hour it is overrun (basically means you have their flag, you don't actually have to stay in one spot. They only have a certain number of flags and since you have one they can't make a new base unless they kill you. Bases are for storing resources.)\n\n-resources: (+whateverpoints for every resource humans didnt find) can't take their food because zombies dont need food, I would however guard the location of the thing just in case somebody comes oo)\n\nTechnicalities:\n\nAt the end of the day\n\n-# how many dead * 10\n\n-honor system\n\n-tally points\n\n-for added fun, when you die you turn into a ghost and you win points for your team when you scare people. Prepare a costume. Points scored based on reaction. Must record using smartphone, better yet gopro.\n\n- freshmen + sophomores are the zombie team\n\n- juniors are the committee people (set up, make up/costumes, hide stuff, make sure no one's getting hurt and everyone's having fun, must be highly secretive about the planning stages, almost cultish)\n\n-seniors are the humans\n\n-donate whatever profit to charity or keep to improve the school. \n\n\nLocation: school with the fire lights on.\n\nGame starts at dawn, ends at dusk.\n\nGOoooooOo.\n\n\nObviously this would require about as much planning as prom, maybe even less. Personally I think it would be more fun though! If Quidditch can happen so can this!\n\nPs. On mobile right now. This post is quite poorly done. Ill fix it soon. Goodnight!",

The site would essentially look as rudimentary as Craigslist and have different jobs listed under each  ticket price. $25 ticket can be worked off for picking up some lumber in your area and hauling it away. $75 may involve spreadsheet creation. Also when you upload y our ticket we will ask you a series of questions and email you potential jobs in your area meeting your criteria. As your time goes by you get email \"1 Week left to pay off ticket\", etc. \n\nMy initial thought would be an escrow situation where the person asking for the service has to send us the money and both parties agree it is complete for us to release the funds. Then we get into a he said/she said kind of thing so maybe it is better to let people decide how they want payment handled. It may not be a bad idea to create that extra step of customer service so people don't get screwed. \n\nAll thoughts are appreciated and encouraged!",

            "selftext": "I got this idea while playing RPG games. There's often a class or a function where the user can build items. \"Get 5 shells and 2 strings to make this thing\". When it gets very complicated and advanced, people will occasionally make entire websites dedicated to just tracking parts and what needs what to be built. (Like in Minecraft tutorials, for example)\n\n\nMy idea is something similar, but applied to the real world. There could be a website database (publicly open, like wikipedia) that keeps track of parts used in household (or bigger) objects. \"These parts are used for this coffee machine\", \"This specific motorcycle uses these parts\", \"This computer is build with these parts\". \n\n\nFor people that are interested in salvaging parts, or building things at home, this would be an absolute treasure trove for ideas and knowledge.\n\n\nThe added bonus of knowing where the parts came *from*, as well, may help give better perspective on humanitarian work. Knowing that something came from some offshore-factory that abuses its workers might give someone incentive to \"vote with their money\" as it were, and decide to invest in an alternative, better company. (If there is one. Making these things transparent would give incentive to create better alternatives, too.)\n\n\nIf all else, I would be curious to see of all the things I could create with a box and some springs.\n\n\nIf I had the time, the knowledge and the means, I would build this website myself. At the moment, I hold minimal design knowledge, unfortunately. But I really don't want this idea to disappear, I think it would be a great contribution for open and free information available to all.\n\n\nThoughts?",

            "selftext": "All of the play as pokemon titles always seemed a little chincy to me. So I had the thought of playing as a wild Pokemon that is living while Red makes his way through his own adventure. \n\nThe game opens with you picking your pokemon. This could be limited to probably 50-75% of the first 150 without feeling to boxed in. You spend the first portion just living, maybe there is a certain amount of resource gathering required or some such to force exploration. At this point if you get into a random encounter with a trainer and lose the game ends (similar to whiting out). This allows a certain amount of leveling up and such. \n\nIt would also be neat to see a bit of customization of your pokemon's looks as the game progresses. This way the choice to evolve becomes more of a choice. If you evolve you lose most, or all, of the customizations you made. Squirtle sized sunglasses will not fit on a wartortle or blastoise for example\n\nThe next stage is your encounter with Red. Whether you win or not you are allowed to choose to go with red or stay wild. If you go with red you continue your adventure with him, defeating team rocket, other trainers, and eventually the elite four.\n\nI am unsure of the actual mechanics of this portion. Your character can be out of the pokeball ala yellow and either have red follow you or have red \"lead\" in front of your footsteps. In cut scenes he would actually be leading you.\n\nIf you choose not to go with red you will fulfill a similar adventure but alone. While other pokemon may assist you from time to time, or you assist them, the major story is you by yourself. This is obviously the much more difficult path.",

I was supposed to turn them over and cook them for 7 more minutes, but now I had no idea how long to put them in again for.\n\nMy idea is simple. The timer will start counting forward after it goes off, and you will know how long it's been off for.

The bag gets stuck in some awkward position and burns, and you wish you could just nudge it a little.\n\nFor these situations, you could swap out the normal spinning glass plate for one with a large piece sticking up out of it, near the edge. This piece would circle around with the plate and push anything that happens to be in front of it, preventing it from getting stuck, saving your popcorn.\n\nYou might think it'd be enough to just place something heavy in next to the bag, but I haven't found anything heavy enough that can be safely set in a microwave. A stuck popcorn bag is a little harder to push than it might seem, and those plates don't have much traction to keep things from sliding. A piece attached to the plate would have a lot more pushing power.\n\nOr how about when you're cooking soup, which needs to be stirred partway through cooking? For these, you could have a stirring spoon which folds down from the top of the microwave, into the food, to stir it as it turns. This spoon would be detachable as well for easy cleaning.",

Even though they aren't as fast as airplanes, with the technological advancements we've made, we could drastically improve the ability of these large airships. One way the design could be improved is by making the zeppelins out of a lighter type of rigid material than they were originally made of. I would suggest some type of metal alloy, or maybe even carbon fiber. If the weight is significantly lighter than that of the original zeppelins, that will allow for a larger passenger and cargo capacity. The engines that power it could be much more advanced as well. We will certainly be able to make zeppelin engines more powerful than they originally were, and they could be powered by alternative/renewable sources of energy. the engines could be electric, and the zeppelin's top half could be covered in solar panels. Or, the zeppelin could be powered by thorium so that it won't have to be refueled for several years. The occupants would also be a lot more comfortable than they would be on a commercial jet. Passengers would have there own rooms that would probably be like hotel rooms, and there would be a dining room / restaurant that served food for breakfast, lunch and dinner.

            "selftext": "I don't know if this is already invented or not, but an idea just popped up into my head this afternoon.\n\n\nI am a high school senior, and I have no idea about electric circuits, physics whatsoever. But I thought it'd be a good idea to have an interactive, PROJECTORLESS whiteboard mainly because school projectors have been the main cause of my bad eye sight. Also personally I think projectors rank second on evil machines after printers. They often malfunction during important meetings, presentations etc and people sometimes have to view the entire presentations in shades of red, blue or yellow (or none...).\n\n\nInteractive whiteboard is already invented (http://smarttech.com/smartboard) and I've used them before in schools. I enjoyed learning with it.\n\n\nBut one common annoyance among all schools I've been to was the projector. Whether it is a crappy ten year old projector or high tech interactive whiteboard, I had to cringe whenever teachers turned on the projectors. Old projector + old whiteboard with creases + super sunny day = eye's worst nightmare.\n\n\nSo here's the idea, not regarding the cost or feasibility of it:\n\n\n1. To make the whiteboard entirely touch screen with LCD (whatever iPad and other tablets are made of).\n\n\n2. Have on/off and settings button (brightness, contrast etc) on the whiteboard instead of a remote control. (Interactive whiteboards came with a remote control, which was actually bit annoying when the LED sensors didn't work properly).\n\n\n3. Have plugin ports on the whiteboard for iPad and other devices. HDMI? something like that..\n\n\n\nConsidering this was invented...\n\n\nPros:\n\n\n* teachers can easily 'carry' the whiteboard around and share the whiteboard with students\n* possible expansion of educational app markets?\n\nCons:\n\n\n* large electricity consumption\n* cables...cables everywhere -> how about a wireless whiteboard like http://www.scriblink.com/ ?",

Any actions you make on that screen would be processed by the server. Screens would all have usb ports for flash drives, mice/keyboards/gaming controlers, etc; headphone jacks for headphones/speakers; GPS for navigation on smaller screens, and for tracking lost/stolen screens of all sizes; and cameras for video calls/pictures. They could also have bluetooth for wireless mice/keyboards/gaming controllers (especially useful for large living room screens), speakers, file transfers, etc. The usb drives, headphone jacks, camera, and bluetooth would all communicate directly with the server, as screens would have limited hardware. Each household would have one server that each household member could log into separately with different accounts.\n\nThis would definitely require some technology that does not yet exist, but when it does, this could be awesome. All of the screens throughout your house would essentially be a powerful PC, and because they're all connected to the same server, they'd all be integrated. You'd no longer have your own PC, but an account on your server that you could log into from any screen and continue from exactly where you left off on the last screen you logged into. Desktops and laptops would be replaced by just monitors with network connectivity or tablets, as they would no longer need bulky hardware. Televisions in living rooms would become large family desktops with the ability to stream, browse the internet, play games, or anything else a PC can do. Because TVs would essentially just be big screen PCs in the living room, PC games would become the standard (hopefully by this time people will have realized that using a controller and a TV connected to a PC to play games makes all arguments for consoles invalid, as this makes it essentially the same experience). Smartphones would also basically just be small but powerful PCs that you carry around. Because the phone antenna is in the server, every screen becomes a phone, which would change the perception of phones and PCs as separate entities. Instead, calling would just be perceived as a standard feature of PCs, as there would no longer be PCs that don't have phones built into the server by which they're powered, and there would no longer be phones that aren't powered by a server that can also make them a powerful PC. Therefore, smartphones would not even be thought of as phones, but handheld PCs. Also, in addition to all of the screens you would have at home and your handheld PC, all of the screens at your friends' houses and their handheld PCs would also be able to connect to your server and allow you to log into your account through Wi-Fi, ethernet, or 4g (5 or 6g by the time this is possible).\n\nI realize we're not quite technologically there yet, but I am excited for the future. We would need much faster network connections that are also available everywhere. I just had an idea as I was writing this to add a gpu and small cpu in each screen to reduce the network speed that would be necessary for this, but I think it'd be cool if we got to the point where all of the processing could be done in the server. It will also be pretty hard to make an operating system that works well on any size screen for both touch and mouse control, though Android may not be too bad for that (sidenote: why didn't Google make Android laptops instead of Chromebooks?). I also just realized as I was writing this, that it's way more likely for large companies to do something like this by charging a fee for an account on their servers, but it'd be way cooler for each household to have its own in which hardware could be customized and shit. In fact, this sounds exactly like something Google would do. But if whatever comes after 4g and fiber is fast enough and I'm rich and know more about how computers work and shit, I'm totally gonna build myself a customized server and hella customized screens and an OS to run it.\n\nDamn I meant for this to be pretty short but I just kept thinking of new things as I wrote it haha.\n\n**TL;DR** Imagine a desktop computer. Replace the actual computer part with a giant, powerful server; replace the monitor with several monitors of various sizes, a TV, and a phone-sized screen that are easy to switch between, mirror, or extend; and replace the HDMI or VGA cable that connects the computer and the monitor with a wireless network that works throughout the world, no matter the distance between server and screen. Now put one of these in every household and allow every household member to have an account on the server(like there can be multiple accounts on PCs), essentially making every screen a PC and perfectly integrating phones, tablets, PCs, TVs, and gaming consoles.

The floor starts moving downward at a very slow speed (1cm/minute) and by piezoelectric or wave energy harnessing type turbines generates electricity. Then, the car owner leaves the parking place and the platform is lifted up by using electricity (ideally a lot less than it generated) so that the next car could start the same process. Your car will be accessible at all times, the ramp will drop and rise with the floor.\nIf this method could yield even a slight net positive energy production, and considering the amount of cars parking every day, this could produce a significant amount of energy.\nWhat technological hurdles would there be? \nWho wants to bootstrap:D?",

Or follow the Olympics in Russian as they're narrated on a local radio station? I think it'd be really cool.\n\nPerhaps users could order a device that they'd keep in their home and connected to the internet. It would capture and transmit viable radio frequencies to the server for anyone to listen to, and as long as they were streaming from their device they would have an active paid subscription to the service. (Perhaps a free subscription wouldn't allow access to stuff like archived audio, and would limit them to only listening to channels inside their own country.) And users could choose between a regular monthly subscription and the essentially one-time fee of a radio device.\n\nThe devices could probably be manufactured on the cheap, and they'd include low-resolution GPS things so that listeners would know the general location of the radio reception, but it'd be imprecise enough that device owners would maintain their privacy. And I can't imagine there being any legal quandaries since the only effect it could have on the various radio channels recorded is to increase the number of people hearing them and their ads.\n\nIt'd also be cool if some people stuck them in their car during long trips (especially truckers), and if the devices also listened to CB radio.

            "selftext": "EDITTED FOR FORMATTING, ORIGINAL BELOW\nThere are some pretty big assumptions, it's a bandaid fix at best but I can try to write it out.\n\nGenetically modify sugarcane to have larger, darker leaves that absorb more light and more air. It also needs to have a less dense stem, or rather a lower limiter on cell construction so that it produces more blackstrap molasses than it a) normally would b) can use.\n\nThat series of genetic modifications means that it cannot survive out in the wild so it requires human care. Even if, say, the pollen escaped, any resultant hybrids with sugarcane would die off pretty quickly because of the sheer number of advantages we're taking away from it.\n\nA plant as inefficient as this requires vast amounts of carbon dioxide in order to fulfill its function but also a lot of water. A large greenhouse-like structure can either provide or subsidize water by evaporating water from a standing pool, preferably placed next to a river for easy, free water. The water condenses on the top of the dome and falls down the side where there is a large U-shaped lip running around the entire edge of the facility. It doesn't have to be a dome but It works pretty well as a dome. The water yeild from one of these domes has been proven to be effective but I forget which country was using it the most to compensate for their low water resources (placing these over salt pools). The plants, if kept in the dome as well, share in the powering sunlight needed for their sugar production.\n\nBlackstrap molasses unfortunately usually comes in 25% concentration of sugar and is usually only yeilded by fully harvesting the sugarcane, but that's resource and area intensive so it would be better to score or spigot the plant like opium from poppy or syrup from maple trees. Either way you need a small collection unit from each plant.\n\nAnyone who runs a fishtank knows that shit builds up on the top of the fishtank and it needs to be cleaned periodically but that cuts into profits so it's good to have someone clean it once every two weeks. In China, next to the yellow river, you can easily set up a facility like this and hire lower-pay workers for a simple job, have the Carbon dioxide available from the local air, and the water (which is pretty polluted IIRC) from the yellow river.\n\nYou are now left with two things as prime yield. Whatever water is left from the collection, and the slightly higher concentrate of blackstrap molasses.\n\nIf pumped into a warm (oh hey look, solar facility, that wouldn't be hard to rig) dark room without oxygen for three months, the molasses can be converted into rum. The rest of it can either stay as molasses (further concentrated in production) or be refined into sugar.\n\nThe rum itself should have a very high alcohol content, enough that if heated at 75 degrees, the vapor that comes off should be a substantial amount of ethyl alcohol (ethanol, or Vodka/moonshine). Recondensed by running the condensing pipe under some cold water (water intake from the river perhaps?) which can then be sold as further fuel for the cars that produced the greenhouse gases in the first place, thus creating a bit of a cycle.\n\nThe problems here are that the actual yeild of blackstrap molasses from standing Genetically modified sugarcane is entirely hypothetical, and thus something that requires experimentation. We know that it's feasible to use regular sugarcane to provide sugar for ethanol fuel but it's still a less efficient process than we'd like.\n\nI personally don't know how much a single genetically unmodified sugar cane can produce, just that 25% sugar content can be drawn from the pressed blackstrap molasses.\n\nAlso, if the plant worked hypothetically perfectly, it'd still not satisfy full market demand, and if it did, then we run the risk of the reverse. Not having enough carbon dioxide to keep up production while we've kept some bad habits as societally acceptable can be a nasty byproduct.\n\nCombined with the cost of research, what's left over is mostly going to be pocket change and PR.\n\nEdit: It is worth noting the only reason I think those main genetic modifications are viable is that we've done the reverse of most of them on tomatoes. Genetically modified tomatoes are made to be firmer, more resistant to blight, have a deeper red hue, and fast-growing (sic, more efficient with their material intake)\n\nPostscript: Unable to find the documentary that gave me the 25% value. For Clarification that's 25% of the mass of the yeilded blackstrap is \"sugar\"\n\nThere's a rant here, but it's required.\nMany apologies for the poor format, I'm not a good writer at all and trying paragraph form would make it much worse.\n\n* ^CO 2, largest quantity of greenhouse gas. Right?\n* Plants take in ^CO 2 and turn it into various things right?\n* trees take a long time to grow plants aren't profitable.\n* Y'know what's profitable? Sugarcane.

Why the heck not? Whether it's outdoors style, or ala fast-food place playground. Who says adults don't want to sit in a hovering plastic car 30 feet in the air and pretending they're driving it, and chase each other through huge yellow plastic tubes? Who doesn't want to jump into a ball pit?\n\nObviously, all the stuff would be build much larger than typical playstuff, as well as have more support, to accommodate adult size. 40 ft tall slides! plastic tic-tac-toe things that are the size of a king bed! That weird black and speckled colored stuff that you used to run around barefoot on at the McDonalds playground! No shoes allowed!

The number part alone won't work.  It only works when people dial it with the letter appended.  The automated phone switches can then verify the letter matches their records, so if the number is misdialed, it can tell you it's a wrong number even if the number part matches someone else.  Also, you would tell your friends your number with the letter appended so they can mentally verify it's the correct number as they dial it (\"Smith, so it should end in an S\", etc.).  When you change phones or move, and the number is assigned to someone else, they will choose their own letter and your letter suffix will no longer work.",

It's basically a pintrest for remodeling.\n\nRather than me sit down with my wife and we go through a bunch of \"I like this, I hate this\". Both of us create a profile, somehow link that we're related and then pick likes and dislikes.\n\nAll the photos will have tags such as, 'recessed lighting' describing them but after you go through enough photos it should be able to nail down what each of our likes and dislikes are.\n\nThis would remove the \"I don't know what it's called, but I like it\" features.\n\nYou could even have a \"Tinder\" mobile app so that when I'm sitting and waiting I can go through kitchen ideas and swipe yay or nay.\n\nAnd then it'll provide a 'personality profile' for the rooms I like. So say after a week of playing with this. It can provide me and my wife with a breakdown of what will work. For example. Every kitchen I like has an island where as she never really picks an island or not. So we go with an island and we're both happy.\n\nOffer different tiers to make money.\n\n- 1 room compatibility match. Free\n- 1 room full with breakdowns of the features each of you liked. $9.99\n- 1 full house. $39.99\n\nPlus you could charge local contractors to be on your website. For example when they click \"I'd like to build this\" it'll link you to some contractors in the area. \n\nSame with vendors. \"Did you notice that 30% of the kitchens you liked had Bosch(tm) appliances!\"",

            "selftext": "The Crazy Idea: A sport where teams fight each other in mock battles using (safe) versions of swords, spears, shields, bows, and other ancient weapons. Tactics would play a huge role as teams try to balance their weapons and players against other teams.\n\nThe Background: Canne. Marathon. Thermopylae. Agincourt. Famous battles have been studied by scholars and generals for hundreds or thousands of years. Ancient and Medieval battles are famous for their use of tactics, but tactics like these are nearly useless in modern warfare, and never seen in modern sports. I want to see teams trying to pull a pincer move, attempting to out-flank each other, or replicating Alexander's \"Hammer and Anvil\" strategy. I want entirely new tactics that would put Hannibal or Julius Caesar to shame. I want to see a phalanx of pikemen deal with an army of samurai. I want teams to replay the real-life \"what-ifs\" of history.\n\n**The Rules**\n\n* Each teams consists of at most 100 players plus 20 mercenaries (see below).\n\n* Two teams per battle.\n\n* Not all players must be on the battlefield at a time. Waves or reinforcements are allowed as long as the total of 100 team players and 20 mercenaries is never exceeded.\n\n* The battlefield itself will be unknown to both teams prior to entering the field. Any obstacles will be symmetric as to not give either team a terrain advantage. Hills, rivers, walls, bridges, buildings, and more are all possibilities.\n\n**Arms**\n\n* All players wear at least light armor that protects against actual injuries, while also keeping track of damage to indicate when the player has \"died\" and must exit the field.\n\n* Heavier armor is also allowed that gives players more \"hit points\", but it weighs significantly more to impede movement and maneuverability.\n\n* All weapons must be re-engineered to not cause any actual harm when used. Bruises are unavoidable, but slicing off limbs is a no-no.\n\n* Ranged weapons are fine as long as they can't cause real harm. Siege engines like ballistas or catapults must also be made to cause no real harm.\n\n* No gunpowder or explosives.\n\n* No horses or motorized vehicles.\n\n**Mercenaries**\n\n* Each team can hire up to 20 local \"mercenaries\" to augment their team. This is the wildcard to make the sport really interesting. Mercenaries must consist people who are not part of any team and can come as groups or as individuals. Perhaps a team wants more experienced archers, or a few more spearmen to use as a diversionary force.\n\n* Mercenaries must be from the region where the battle is taking place. If LA and Miami are playing in Chicago, then both teams only get to choose from the Chicago mercenaries.\n\n* Mercenaries are hired for whatever deal they can negotiate. Maybe it's merchandise. Maybe cash. Maybe the promise to always pick them in future battles. Maybe just the chance to prove themselves on the field. If both teams want the same mercenaries, the mercenaries decide which team to fight for.\n\n* Mercenaries are under no obligation to follow their team's general once the battle begins. History is filled with mercenaries switching sides, retreating, or refusing to fight. Doing so will hurt their reputation in future matches, but that risk is part of the game.\n\nThoughts?",

This way, we could have a novel research topic, and we could have our very own data. We would even have a neat little methods section, rather than just citing a bunch of other IEEE papers. I even showed them how I could get the data from the ngram search and run correlation sets on data sets. Basically it's a way of doing real science with quantitative analysts and everything, rather than making up a pretend research report like everyone else.    \n    \nI just couldn't come up with a specific question to answer.    \n    \nsome other guy said we should compare electric cars to gas cars, and applications in public transportation. Fucking wow, that would have been interesting and provocative 15 years ago. I can not think of anything more boring to base 2 big writing projects off of. We can't collect data, all we can do is read unbearably boring papers and try to bullshit some sort of cost-benefit analysts or something. I HATE the idea.   \n   \nBut it's not fleshed out yet, and on Tuesday I am going to make an attempt to sway them away from the electric cars thing. I just need a really fleshed out, tangible research topic because they don't seem to have the imagination to contribute to my idea (odiously nor do I or I would have come up with something on my own)    \n    \nIv'e had a few thoughts but I'm not sure how well they will go over:    \n    \n* is there a negative correlation in the use of phrases and their corresponding conjugations?    \n* Can one predict an election based on frequency analysts of the candidate's name? of so, does the accuracy of this prediction change over time?    \n* Is there a positive correlation between phrases who represent to be opposing cultural dichotomies (prolife vs choise, communism vs capitalism,  ETC)\n   \nAny thoughts or ideas?

            "selftext": "I'm sure we're not the only school that does this, but my college has students nominate faculty members for excellence in teaching awards every year. Basically, if the students want someone nominated, they have to fill out a form with a bunch of different questions on it about how the Professor teaches, how that Professor's teaching style helps students learn, etc. \n\nEvery semester we are also required to fill out teacher evaluation forms, but a lot of students just blow them off and give the professor '5's (the highest score) across the board so they can be done with it. \n\nIt occurred to me the other day that, if a teacher really was wonderful, wouldn't students want to go out of their ways to make sure the school knew about it? Think about it- if a professor really is getting a student excited about learning, why wouldn't the student want to share with the school what a good job their professor was doing? \n\nNow I know young people aren't that proactive, but if they're passionate about something they would be more inclined to share it. \n\nAll that being said, it would make more sense to evaluate professors based on what students say about them in these nominations. Because they aren't required, students are more inclined to take time to be honest about what makes that professor so good. Then, if there's a professor that is consistently not being nominated they can focus on finding out why. \n\nI know it's not a perfect system- some professors and teachers just slide by in the middle, but it could be a step in helping schools accurately judge how well their teachers are connecting with their students.",

Testing with skid pads, high speeds, some night driving, etc.  This course could also teach basic defensive driving.\n\nI think that if you successfully complete a course like this you have demonstrated that you can handle driving in \"hairier\" situations and you should enjoy reduced insurance premiums for it.\n\nThis is just me (small rant), but I doubt insurance companies would ever do this, unfortunately.  There is way too much money to be made from gouging young drivers who could \"test out\" of the higher premiums in the course.  The fact that [insurance companies lobby for lower speed limits so they can raise premiums for speeding tickets](http://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/pa346.pdf) shows they would be less than willing to do this (/small rant).\n\nThoughts?",

            "selftext": "Inspired by [this post.](http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/216v56/anime_psyduck/cgachk4)\n\nExample: Pokemon. Over the entire run of the show, Ash has been 10-11 years old and has maintained the same general plot over and over. Which makes sense, considering the executives are marketing the anime for children in order to sell toys and games and all that. \n\nThey'd still be able to do that, but AT THE SAME TIME they can create an off-shoot/spin-off/whatever.\n\nFor people who have grown up with the Pokemon (like myself), maybe they would be interested in seeing the main character, Ash Ketchum, grow up, have mature interpersonal relationships, begin actually showing development in his career choice as a Pokemon Master.\n\nI think this idea would be great specifically for cartoons targeting children that have maintained a great adult following, like Adventure Time. I know Adventure Time does have some mature themes and threads that do connect over the entirety of the show, but how interesting would it be if Finn grew up? Or had an episode arc with one particular event in his life? The Lich episodes were awesome! Why couldn't that be extended over a season?\n\nThink of the rabid following Pokemon has? It has this great adult/mature fan base, that would only INCREASE if the show matched the mature parts of the game/art.\n\nThere are examples of media and franchises that have \"grown up\" with their demographic. The most obvious example is Harry Potter. Even the books grew up in subject matter and reading level. Why wouldn't that be applicable to cartoons or children's shows in general? Bridging the gap? \n\nThey could even broadcast them at the same time, but leave the serialized version online or on another channel or even the same one but in primetime as opposed to the morning. \n\nThe only thing I'm wondering if if there are any shows that do this now?",

            "selftext": "Some people just have no idea how to interact with other people. That might be because of autism, being raised in the middle of nowhere with little opportunity to practice, etc. The only way they can learn is to go out and try it, but that can be difficult - if your social skills aren't what they should be for your age, people look at you funny, like there's something really wrong with you. It's also difficult to get feedback this way, it takes time (and money if you're visiting coffee shops all the time), you have to find opportunities to practice different scenarios, and you have to deal with the awkwardness if you screw up with someone you see often. Plus if you screw up with someone who has a strong social network, word gets around and now you're being shunned by people you don't even know.\n\nTo solve this problem, someone who knows a lot about social interaction should help develop a video game, similar to Japanese dating sims. Instead of being a purely-entertainment game where you try to figure out the script to get into some virtual girl's panties, it'd be a game where you try to make friends and relationships in real-world scenarios. The characters could be scripted and/or AI and would try to behave as real people would. The game would give you options like \"move closer\" and \"offer your phone number\" and would then give feedback on whether now is an appropriate time to perform that action.\n\nIf this were designed well enough, it'd be an ideal way for people to learn the basics of social interaction in comfort. No embarrassing themselves in front of real people. No making things at school/work awkward for months because of one dumb thing they did ages ago. No having to go out and spend a bunch of time and money going to some place just in the *hopes* of getting to practice some scenario. The ability to practice the same or similar scenarios over and over until you understand what to do, with detailed feedback about what you did right and wrong.\n\nI'm imagining a mostly menu-based system, where you just choose an action and get feedback. But since facial expressions, body language, and tone of voice are all important here, the game could use a camera to recognize these things and react to them. The game might also have a mode where characters display different facial expressions, postures, voices, etc and it quizzes you on how they might be feeling so that you can learn to understand those.",

Reading a book with a recovering alcoholic who lapses, I was thinking that this could also apply for alcohol.\n\nThe major issue is that there are a lot of places that sell alcohol, so for this to be effective you'd need to exclude yourself from a great many separate businesses, which may be impractical. Some alternatives:\n\n1)  Have debit/credit cards that automatically reject alcohol purchases. Problem: can be overcome by using cash. So it might only be effective in a future where cash is phased out, or if cash is banned from alcohol purchases (which would inconvenience many non-problem drinkers). Still, having to get cash out might be a reasonable deterrent, and can be assisted by the alcoholic avoiding using cash in everyday life. \n\n2) Have the option of a \"Do Not Serve Alcohol\" symbol on your ID card. Problem: doesn't work if you're not carded. Might need to be implemented with a universally carding policy, which could again inconvenience non-problem drinkers.\n\nThere's also the whole other ballpark of other people giving you alcohol, but hopefully if you're a recovering alcoholic you can stay away from friends who'll supply you in moments of weakness.",

I've asked him to wear headphones but I know it's just not the same; you need that body-vibrating bass that comes with an awesome sound system for the immersion. \n\nWhat do you think of a gaming/movie-watching chair that has a headphone cable, transmitting the low frequencies of any incoming audio to subwoofers that are built into the chair (with foam under the legs to prevent the transmission of the bass to the floor), and a headphone port to allow the use of your favorite headphones?\n\nWith this chair, you'd be able to immerse yourself in the entertainment experience without disturbing others.",

However there is a culture thing in the US that going out into different countries makes you \"worldly\" and the like. What I'm proposing is taking some of the McDonalds that aren't already \"high volume operators\" and make them McDonalds International. These locations would cater specifically serving some of the options that can be found currently only in regional McDonalds. \n\nThings like:\n\nTzaTziki Wrap (courtesy of the Mediterranean)\n\nChicken Porridge with Veges (courtesy of Malaysia)\n\nNurnburger (Brautwurst burger courtesy of Germany)\n\nShrimp Burger (courtesy of Asia)\n\nThese wouldnt have to be the exact choices, but having a restaurant devoted to things you can only get in other parts of the world gives McDonalds a one up over their domestic competitors that already has the fast food burger esque market cornered. They wouldnt have to change any of the recipes, and actually gives them a viable reason to be charged extra as certain ingredients are \"brought in from far away\". Honestly they are already serving the food in other places, whats to stop them from serving it here, having it charged at a premium and making rediculous sums of money. Just an idea.\n\nHell if you wanted to you could go full force and put them in high traffic areas so people feel like they are traveling to another country all together without the pricy international plane ticket and everyone feels like they went to a different country. Billy feels like he went to Japan with his Shrimp Burger. Mom gets something healthy and feels like she went to the Mediterranean. Dad gets his hearty meat filling in the Nurnburger and McDonalds rakes in the cash.",

This fee also helps combat crap being flooded into the store as you have to fork out for each app. However the fee can't be too large for fear of alienating small developers.\n\nWhat if app developers paid by the permissions the app needs to cover testing efforts by Google or Apple. A standard base payment would exist however you would need to pay more for each invasive permission your app needs.\n\nFor examples: \n- if you're just an indie game dev and want to upload a small game like, say, flappy bird. All that needs is a low bandwidth internet connection and the ability to go full screen. These things have very little abuse potential and so the developer would pay very little.\n- developing a social media app which wants to take your phone number and other such details (*cough*Facebook messenger*cough*)? Pay up.\n\nIt could also deter developers from just slapping permissions on  where they aren't necessary (a problem particular to the play store in my experience as an android user.)",

Basically this website allows educated people to be hired by those who lack knowledge, but need the skills to write an essay or debate on website forums against highly educated opponents.\n\nThe mechanism is pretty simple. It is the portal that allows to meet people with skills and people with no skills. Every transaction is made on the site between the customers from both sides. People with skills offer their skills, people who require skills buy the skills.\n\nEvery transaction or communication are made anonimously, so nobody from both sides knows each other. This menas that every kind of intellectual property belongs only to the customer. And there is no risk of being decieved. There are three sections on website:\n\n1 Offering skills\n\n2 Requesting skills\n\n3 Marketplace\n\nWhen both sides agree on transaction, they meet in market place, both users must click on the button agree, which makes transfer the intellectual property and the money on their accounts. The transaction is possible only when both sides agree. And there is guarantee. Because the website personnel is responsable of identities.\n\nAnybody who wants to destroy his opponent on a web forum, or write an essay, or anything else that requires hiring an educated person in the field of requested knowledge can be found on this site.\n\nPrices are not fixed, the price is floationg according to how much popular the author is. And how much positive feedback they get.\n\nThe website \"Rent a skill\" gets the 15% from any transaction.\n\nAny feedback is appreciated. This idea is just a draft right now.",

What if I want to search a quote but not put a certain word in the middle. For example, if I want to search lyrics to a song I heard on the radio, but I didn't catch a word in between, such as, \"You know I can't love you anymore because ______ did it to me\" I didn't catch the word in the middle so the only way I can search it is if I put both the lyrics before and after the skip in individual quotation marks. But doing that might give me irrelevant results where the first quote is not even close to the second one. Need better explanation? What if I want to search for the meme that goes, \"What is this? A _____ for ants??\" I can't really search for that meme on Google because the only way I can search for it is by searching \"What is this? A\" and \"for ants\" in separate quotation marks. Doing that just gives me results with those words used seperately, there needs to be a way to put it in quotation marks with a word that can be anything in the middle.",

But I find I increasingly desire an app to find music that has the same message.\nAt first you could have people upload and tag their own songs to the app/website. So they could upload Same Love by Macklemore and tag it with gay rights, equality, and maybe have tags for what mood it has (because maybe you want a song that is more or less somber). And when you listen to a song, you could upvote tags you agree with. And the highest upvoted tags are the ones the song is identified by.\nSo if I was in the mood to listen to songs about love, I could just search \"Love\" and songs that have that tag (and similar tags) upvoted the most, would be put into a playlist.\nThis would also be awesome to be able to cross tag to find songs about things you find interesting. Such as searching the tags \"Love\" and \"Loss\" and getting songs about both of those topics such as Say Something by A Great Big World.\nI think if I were ever able to pull this app together, I would call it Lyrically or Lyrical or something like that.  \n  \n[Original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/CrazyIdeas/comments/22wxuq/an_app_like_pandora_but_for_finding_songs_with/)",

You put one in the kitchen and one in the *way* back of the pantry. Once you're done with that first jar, you may not remember whether you have any more peanut butter or not. so you go out and buy some groceries that you don't need. These groceries could add up to a lot of wasted money.\n\nBut if you had an electronic system, you would be able to check which supplies you had in stock.

            "selftext": "I can't be the only one. I'm only 18 and I've felt this way for years, and I can't seem to find a word, or a movement, or an advocate of this ideology I seem to have cooked up. In the simplest terms possible, I want for there to be an ideology that can argue against the norms of modern urban planning. Not to say that the precepts of modern urban planning are all bad, it could be far worse, but I don't understand why I've never in my life heard, and I'm not very well versed in urban design so I could just be ignorant, someone, anyone arguing in opposition to gridplans, or the hegemony of the automobile, or post-modern/minimalist laziness, or anything of the sort. There are a select few European countries, such as the UK, France, the Netherlands, who have a tradition of, in the modern day, building in the old style, but that has been thought of more as preservation or a momentary antiquatedness against the inevitable rupturing wave of modernism, when that doesn't have to be the case.\n\nI could write a whole manifesto on the topic, but the simple matter of the fact is that *it does not have to be that way*. We can be more aspirational, and I have a very strong belief that the environs of a human population acutely effect their outlook. There hasn't been any scientific work done on the topic to my knowledge, but I, having grown up in this godforsaken oil town in middle-western Canada and travelled to far-flung places such as Somalia, Kuwait and Ethiopia, have always noticed the layout of people's environs are incredibly influential on their outlook. Hollow, soulless, dystopian cities, such as those which are found all throughout North America, and in some parts of the developing world, breed a consumerist and trite culture, whereas cities and towns which are more aesthetically pleasing and less grand-planned tend to be more intellectual. I agree that this is not scientific, and take this with several pillars of salt because I may very well be wrong, but while there are of course exceptions, I feel heavily inclined to adopt that position, I suppose largely because it does agree with my own half-baked ideology.\n\nOf course anecdotal evidence is no good, but observation generally proves that regions with architectural splendour breed a different culture from those places that don't. Now, I'm not trying to say this makes people from X place better than people from Y place, but simply that if this is the case, the question of architecture isn't just a superfluous one of \"ooh, pretty buildings\". These things matter far, far more deeply than are assumed. Indeed, a society that is pragmatic and has little care for aesthetic would in that case be very unsatisfied, or oblivious, which can't be a good thing. Arcane and esoteric architecture, I feel, must do something to the developing mind that we don't quite understand. It's not some woo-mumbo-jumbo that we figure out with divining rods. There is probably research that can be used to credit or discredit this idea. When people are brought up in an adult environment that has the symbols and signs of the concerted efforts of society it has an effect. \n\nThroughout my life, whether it be in Kuwait, or Hargeysa, or Addis Abbeba, the people who live where the buildings had the most architectural splendour generally had a different, not necessarily better, but I feel in some aspects more intellectual outlook than those who lived on the straight-streets, and 4 way intersections, and front lawns and so on of \"suburbia\". Places like San Diego and Dubai inspire superficiality and depression if anything. It's places like Quebec and St.Petersburg, with their celebration of society through architecture that maintain sanity. I say this as someone who deals with depression living in cold bland suburbia, environments that are societal works that convey symbols, even when gloomy or possibly even ones I don't agree with, those are certainly better for society. Of course, architecture is not the only factor, just one factor, but it is a very powerful one, and the fact that the status quo has become pragmatic blandness I fear that the free-market is creating a depressive, dystopian that are anathema to good civilisation.\n\nTo conclude, I also bring this up because what I like to term \"a lack of vision\" is the global status quo. The developing countries of today are building their foundations on the precepts of modern urban planning. I see this as a terrible thing. American and Soviet ideals of towns and cities are depressing places, and the world over developing countries are either following the Capitalist or Socialist dystopian designs.\n\n_________________\nEdit: As you can tell, this was very difficult, even a little painful to write. I wish I could have done better, but I think if I want to get some responses and spark a bit of discussion this is enough. There's a lot of me whining in there, but I get my main points across, although it may be a bit repetitive at times.",

This isn't a promotional video, and I don't even mention my DJ name in it. I will make a more \"public\" oriented video of it before the tour, but this is more for showing to those who may be interested in it and for family/friends.\n\n[A low res video of what I made along with an explanation is here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-Ahpr0Dlao)\n\nUnfortunately I won't have a visual set up on the tour, so 3D projection or other types of visual things aren't possible right now. Thoughts, ideas, improvements, questions, etc. are all welcome!\n\nThanks :)",

(We will call him Jack)\n- Jack lives a normal mundane life with a visibly perfect marriage that has fractures if you look close enough.\n- Through only 5 seasons, the viewers mood will be brought from indifferent, almost bored; to dark, loosing hope; to desperate and not having faith that the protagonist, or anyone else in the world could possibly survive. (i.e. Hope>No Hope)\n \nThe plot: A plague breaks out in a plain mid-sized town in North America. We watch through the eyes of our protagonist as the town he lives in, (and then the greater world) slowly descends in to chaos and approaches a seeming apocalypse. \n\nMain character:\nJack starts the series believing his depressing suburban life is as bad as life gets. Jack then slowly starts experiencing traumatic hits to his life that progressively get worse as the series goes on. Jack grows from a sensitive , almost fragile character who feels hopeless from little conflict to a more wise, (yet numb from all of his loss) protagonist. He grows from this sensitive personality, to a strong figure yet with a bleak sensitivity to life.\n\nThe Plague:\nThrough out Jack's tumultuous mid-life coming of age story, the series revolves around a Black-Death-esq killer plague that is seemingly incurable. If any hope appears that the fast spreading disease may be defeated, it is quickly shattered as the viewer is lulled into a false sense of security.\n\nNo Zombies:\nPeople get seriously sick, they die horrible, horrible deaths, but they DO NOT come back to life.\n\nWhat do you think?",

This is when I remembered that I had the same problem when I was very young. I also remembered how I used video games to help me learn proper conversational structure and all that good stuff as well as helping to increase my vocabulary.  \n\n\nSo my idea is... What if games had an option where you could have the audio language of your choice and then 2 sets of subtitles one for the audio language and one of the translation to another language.  \n\n\nImagine trying to learn Russian playing Metro 2033, using the Russian audio and having Russian and English subtitles at the same time.",

So essentially we are in Europe for a month, but we want to spend our time seeing as much as we can, on the cheap.\n\nI select arrival and departure date and select my budget, lets say $500.\n\nThe website works out the most cost effective flight schedule and returns an itinerary of cities based around my budget. \n\nFor example:\n\n* July 3 - London to Paris\n\n* July 10 - Paris to Berlin\n\n* July 17 - Berlin to Athens\n\n* July 23 - Athens to Dublin\n\n* July 25 - Dublin to London\n\n    \n* Total - $497.50\n\nOnce we have this raw data, it could be used to generate an image really selling the trip (e.g. **Amazing Europe Tour**, Visit 5 sensational cities for **under $500**, *offer effective as at xx/xx/xxx*). \n\n\nThis image could then be shared to friends and family across social networks with a link to purchase the flights. \n\n",

            "selftext": "Here is how it would work:\n\nFirst you make an account. Then, you randomly get assigned an old user, who has now passed away. You will get access to whatever resources this person chose to make public on their account: family members contact info, facebook page, etc. Then your task is to create a small project to honor this person. It would be something like a slideshow, or maybe a fictional short story whose protagonist is based off of the person. There would be a bit of freedom on what kinds of projects you can make.\n\nBesides making projects, you can view and rate projects that others have made.\n\nMaking projects, as well as rating, commenting and viewing other's projects all earn you points. When you die, a contact who you have arranged with the website will inform the site admins of your death, and your account will become locked. The amount of points you have earned determines the frequency that new users will be assigned you to make projects based off of you in the future.\n\nThere would be two main goals: One is to foster the remembrance of normal people after they died, who otherwise may have been forgotten. This is because being a celebrity in real life has no influence over how many points you can get. Two is to provide an outlet to people who are dying of an incurable illness etc, or just anyone scared of death, who are afraid that they will be forgotten after they die.\n\nThere are a few other bits I am not sure about. For example, could a mother \"give\" her points to her child that is dying of cancer but is too young or weak to use the website theirself?\n\nI know this has been a very grim post, but the idea is that this website would be a very positive thing and would make a lot of people happy for different reasons. It could be interesting studying the life of a \"normal\" person in history for once rather than a famous person.\n\nThe website could be called \"Never Forgotten\" or something like that. It would be completely free to use.",

My lamp recently broke-I don't know when or how, but it is a Arteluce Mira S model-the one that is also referred as to the pendant design. Not only is it hard to change, I can't find anything on how to change it. If this is the wrong subreddit, please tell me so I can get some help! \n\nThank you for your time and patience.\n(Probably badly formatted, my apologies.)\n\nEDIT: oh gosh this was foolish wasn't it...\nBut in terms of actual ideas, I think this subreddit is really cool. \n\nWhat do you think of a financial market that is for those under 18 purely-they experiment with their own stock profile without necessarily having to worry about high frequency traders? I'm not sure about this because I started trading when I was 14, and have continued ever since. Even though I had very little free time, it was rather invigorating, but a bit frustrating when there were huge shocks going through the markets. Perhaps a more regulated and smaller one, still dealing with real money but with less risk would be stimulating.",

Imagine being a kid and getting to reveal these delicious little secrets... and then bite their heads off.\n\nAnother side-product would be the Frozen Caveman Popsicle.

Totally fuckin excited. \n\n>**The TV commercial**, that would air on Treehouse (or any another kid's channel, really), would start off animated with caveman hunters traversing the frozen tundra armed with spears and other ultra deadly weapons. All of a sudden, the ice cracks and they all slide into the freezing water - roaring like the warriors they are, they scratch and claw as the ice heaves and buckles. Their demise is sealed.\n\n>A time-lapse begins, fast-forwarding thousands of years until we reach our present day where cranes and machines are extracting the precious ice cream, unknowingly grabbing up our tribe of cavemen in the process. \n\n>The ice cream is then shown being packaged into boxes and shipped out. \n\n>Cut to a live action shot of a kid eating his dessert and discovering the intact frozen cavemen.

I want a coat that hangs long (below butt) and has lots of underside venting- under armpits, flap on  back of shoulders, loose sleeves at wrist that can be buttoned to the middle of arm. The challenge is that it needs to be lightweight enough to allow the flapping of the fabric to funnel air around your body to keep you cool, but still keep the afternoon rainshowers from drenching you.  Or maybe have it just let you get wet and then dries in a flash. This is bigger than just a shirt that does these things so that you can wear it constantly to block the heat and improve airflow.",
