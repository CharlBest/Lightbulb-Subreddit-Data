            "selftext": "Summary: Require all newly manufactured guns to be equipped with new tough safety features, thus making all existing guns instantly more collectible and more valuable, which will eventually lead to fewer older guns on the street.\n\nDetail:\n\nNew guns would be just as available to purchase, but by law all newly manufactured guns produced would have to include integrated tamper-proof safety features such as fingerprint check or PIN code entry, RFID, GPS, RF presence beaconing, etc.   These new guns could have further limits on clip size or other features.   This is in line with the way that new cars, power tools, etc must include modern safety features.\n\nPeople who want old style guns (without the safety bells and whistles) would have to buy from the existing pool of guns.   This should keep current gun owners and collectors happy since their guns will become more valuable and even more collectible.    Some may want to preserve their value by keeping them in their original condition.   The more valuable old guns become the fewer will be on the street.   Eventually it may be more lucrative for a criminal to sell a gun than to use it for small robbery.   Buy-back programs could reduce the number of old style guns even further if desired.\n\nThe market takes care of things.   Gun manufacturers can still produce guns (just with new features).  People who want a new gun can still buy one.  Collectors and existing owners can be happy that their guns are worth more and more.   No new restrictions are placed on existing guns.\n\nI realize that there are many details to work out and that new issues may arise (such as bootlegging, smuggling, etc) - but the underlying idea of letting the market take care of things should be able to appeal to a larger population than most other gun control ideas.\n\nFeels like there\u2019s an idea in here somewhere.",

            "selftext": "Greetings r/Lightbulb!\n\nMy innovation class and I have thought of developing an app which will give and/or store information at your wish!\n\nThe main purpose of this app is to recieve and save detailed information which is relevant to you during a meeting, an event or at an open house-arrangement. And if you wish to get in contact with the host or presenter, optional business cards will be available aswell in the app.\n\nI've been coming up with two functions for this application to work:\n\n1. Use a custom made QR-code generator with an in-app scanner.\n2. Use the GPS system in your phone to locate other users nearby currently using the app (Specifically for business cards/direct information sharing)\n\nAccording to a short survey I've made, there is a pain: - people think that the information they're given at a certain time quite quickly vanishes from their memory, so in order to store information, a host, a presenter, or any person in particular has to create an article, or a business card to quickly summarize the context of the subject.\n\nExample: You're at an open house arrangement. You're listening to people at different booths and getting information that might be interesting for you to look more into. That's where this app comes in handy. You open the app, scan the code/recieve a business card and a link to an article is stored in the app, ready for you to read when you get home, or during a break.\n\nWe are quite sceptical around the whole QR-code scanning idea, since we think this feature is a petty attempt to create a faster, easier and shorter way to open links, and it has worn off ever since it's release.\nI've been researching the QR-code industry together with my class. Although people are still using the service, tempoarily, not everyone are aware of when they are using it. For instance, barcodes, encrypted messages, etc. But if we can use this feature to get it back on the market, we're more than likely willing to give it a try.\n\nI've wanted to contact an app developer, to see where the cost range for developing and designing an app will be at, with descriptions like the ones mentioned above, plus the GUI and storage function. Currently, we haven't recieved an answer yet.\n\nWe're open to any feedback, critizisms and questions about the app in general or anything else.",

            "selftext": "Hi!\n\nSo I've been developing this idea for a while now. Basically its a service that allows users to view a database of sex workers to conduct business with. \n\nAPP: I developed this concept of a triangle communication system. The potential customer chooses a variety of choices based on gender and services they are interested in. The database presents a variety of workers based on criteria and proximity,(the worker must be signed in and online to be made available) and displays the worker's services and rates along with rating, pics and general info(STD test). If interested, the customer can send a request to chat with the worker. When the request is made the worker will receive a notification and has 2 mins to review the customer to screen them and make a decision. If the worker accepts, a line of communication will be established between the customer and worker. Now think of a whatsapp style chat where the two parties agree on a location and time. The worker can also send pics to try and win the customer.\n\nPAYMENT: Now the customer can either choose to pay with credit or cash. The way the app makes money is that we take a percentage of the transaction to pay for our service. Our database of customers is valuable to the worker, as well as the safety of screening their customers and talking with them before the transaction. If paid in cash, the app holds a record of the transaction and the worker must pay the percentage owed at the end of the month to continue using the service.\n\nLEGALITY: This will not be legal in the United States. The markets would be Canada and most of Europe. In Canada, prostitution is in the grey area in legality. A year ago the Supreme Court of Canada struck down our old laws concerning the sex trade and deemed them unconstitutional. They gave the government one year to rewrite them, and at that time we had a Conservative government. They rewrote them to be pretty much the same. I am very confident that the Supreme Court will strike down the new laws and make the government rewrite them again. However this time, they would be rewritten by a majority Liberal government and I know that prostitution will become fully legal. In most of Europe prostitution is fully legal.\n\nPRIVACY: This is the tricky part. I was thinking of having a two step verification system like twitter, google, microsoft, apple, etc.\nWhen the user first opens the app, they will be prompted to make a username/password and provide their phone number. There will also be a choice to add fingerprint verification as well.\nThe app would only hold this information: Username/Password, Phone Number, (Fingerprint would be on the phone), credit card info(if given) and past transactions.\n\nI am beginning to learn how to code and I am drawing rough sketches of how the app will function and look. I know this app idea is not achievable on my own, I need to develop a team of like minded individuals. Specifically we would need programmers, security experts, and lawyers. But anyone is welcome! \n\n\nI know this is an idea full of conspiracy, but that's what makes it so interesting. Imagine a future where sexual services are available at the tip of your fingers. We could truly be, the Uber of Sex.\n\n\nThank you for your time! Hope it was a good read :)",

            "selftext": "Hi everyone :)\n\nLong time lurker dig this subreddit!\n\nI really love software testing and finding bugs and the idea for this all started when I was browsing realestate.com.au a popular realestate website in Australia and discovered a bug that I went on to report directly to a contact at realestate. At the time I thought to myself, wouldn't it be great if an application or website existed where testers and companies could register, companies or startups would submit their applications and testers could visit their applications and report bugs and even earn money for their findings.\n\nI released The Bug Exchange http://www.thebugexchange.com a few months later and it seems to be doing great. But what I really need is some feedback from the Reddit community to grow and improve the app? tips? recommendations? or even some more people to check it out any feedback much appreciated.\n\nI hope this does not come across as some sort of sales pitch I just really want more feedback to improve the application. For now I am focused on seeking out more companies and startups to join and submit their applications. We have over 50+ testers registered so far who seem to love finding bugs as much as I do.\n\nLet me know your thoughts guys!",

            "selftext": "Here in Wisconsin we have ridiculously cold winters, but still get plenty of hot days in the summer. My idea is to create a simple ice storage system on the roof of any large building that will use ambient temperature during the winter to create a huge block of ice, which will be used throughout the summer for cooling. \n\n1: A large tank with heavily insulated sides, a coil of water tubing, and a removable lid will be filled with a few inches of water at a time. As this water freezes, more water will be added to the top. This way, layer by layer, a solid block of ice will easily be formed.\n\n2: Once the temperature starts to rise, the lid will be put in place to insulate the whole thing. The bottom will have a grating so that melt water flows out into a storage tank, and keeps the ice from melting too quickly. \n\n3: When cooling is required, water can be cycled through the coil. This could provide enough cooling on its own, or could be used to pre-cool before using a refrigeration system.\n\n4: The melt water can be used for flushing toilets or irrigation.\n\nAll of this would require just a few sensors and an electronically controlled valve. The lid and bottom grating could be manually opened/closed, since it only needs to be moved twice a year.",

I think if criminals knew the exact penalties it would overall disincentivize crime. \n\nSo the Government should publicize easy to understand lists of crime penalties.

You won't regret it.\"--only if other graffiti is already present, of course.\n-Order a bunch of their stickers (if they have any) and stick them in places where there are other band stickers\n-Post flyers on telephone poles\n\nAnd that's about all I've got so far.

Once the MOF is full, it will be heated to release the carbon dioxide molecules whereas the other molecules willbe released beforehand.\nthe carbon dioxide gas will then be liquified, then solidified (dry ice); and water will be added to the dry ice to create cold steam (what comes ou of dry ice machines).\nthe cold steam will power turbines that will create electricity.\nI would like you to check this link to see how it would work \nhttps://youtu.be/X6b7r0w7CpM\n",

They're all either hues of mauve, pink, purple, or black and it seems all the emphasis is on functionality, at the expense of designing cute or elegant or quirky or memorable products. I really would love to see customizeable sex toys that can be printed with images (respecting copyright boundaries) to suit the user's particular sense of style, the same way the you can customize your phone background or have personalized credit card backgrounds printed. It'd even spike sales up for the sake of gag gifts--I can see a huge profit generated by bachelorette parties, getting massive dildoes printed with the groom's face on them, or as prank gifts adorned with farcical politicians. And I think the target demographic would be wide-reaching, including all sexualities and genders, not just women. I'd love to work on this, but I have limited entrepreneurial experience. ",

Which is the whole point, but annoying for people that need to talk to you.\n\nPut a couple of microphones on the outside of the headphones and the ability to respond to a wake-word so that you're SO can say \"Hey, Bose\" (hopefully you could just set it to your name), which would pause the music (or whatever) and allow your SO to ask you a quick question.\n\nObviously, being able to turn this feature on and off would be ideal.  And changing the wake-word, otherwise people on the airplane could troll your headphones.\n\nThis might eat into battery life, if they were wireless, too.\n\nI did a super-quick google search and couldn't find anything like this.",

            "selftext": "Addiction is a noun used to describe A strong and harmful need for and use of a habit-forming substance characterized by tolerance and well defined physiological symptoms\n\nneed - verb\n\nhabit forming - verb - requires action to form a habit\n\nuse - verb\n\n\nAddiction is an idea (a noun) used to describe the connection between physically picking up, using, and abusing a substance or activity, and the negative impacts it has on your life. However, \u201caddiction\u201d can\u2019t exist without action. I cannot become addicted without imposing myself on that thing first. Any time we talk about \u201caddiction\u201d, we\u2019re actually changing the thing were talking about when we say the word, \u201caddiction\u201d. How can one be \u201caddicted\u201d when being \u201caddicted\u201d is but simply the repetitive use of taking drugs\u2026 this might sound like bat shit lunacy but try to understand: When I say, \u201cI\u2019m a drug addict\u201d instead of \u201cI\u2019m a person who habitually ingests drugs to the point of harming myself\u201d, i\u2019m painting a different picture. Addict is an ambiguous idea, it can mean anything because its an idea used to describe a set of circumstances that are too, entirely up for interpretation. For instance, Is a person an addict if they are a famous musician and ingest heroin regularly to cope with touring all the time and back problems? See, that\u2019s just a totally different picture than saying, \u201cKurt Cobain was a drug addict\u201d. Although Cobain was (in the sense of the IDEA of \u201caddiction\u201d) a drug addict, his addiction had a meaningful purpose for being there, rather than being \u201cjust a drug addict.\u201d\n\nThe reason drug addiction is not a disease is because the meaningful purpose for cancer is always the same and never different (that meaningful purpose being, we can see how cancer spreads and affects the body, and can document it and see it replicate scientifically). This being said, anybody can be \u201cjust another cancer patient\u201d because the entire idea of cancer is routed in science and fact and is essentially unchanging for the most part. \u201cJust another\u201d implies something has been happening and will continue to. Let me explain why \u201cjust another drug addict\u201d doesn\u2019t apply to the rule: The meaningful purpose for drug addiction is entirely different all across the board. This is because \u201cdrug addiction\u201d as a Condition, does not exist. (Stay with me, I swear it makes sense)\n\nCondition - noun - the state of something, especially with regard to its appearance, quality, or working order.\n\nNobody in the world is \u201cin the state of being addicted to drugs\u201d or \u201cbeing a drug addict\u201d because there can be no base line to even define what the state of being a drug addict is. Therefore, any time you say \u201cdrug addict\u201d, you\u2019re really talking about whatever version you have in your head. I know what you\u2019re thinking, \u201cyou could say that about anything\u201d. Well, not exactly, we\u2019ve seen time and time again how lung cancer progresses, to the point where we can see the stages of cancer. When I say \u201ccancer patient\u201d we all know what that means and looks like, it doesn\u2019t change, cancers trajectory is foreseeable, scientifically.\n\nAddiction is neither a choice, nor a disease. Addiction is a behavior. Kurt Cobain\u2019s heroin problem was a response to his confusion about his role with his music and his back problems. A homeless vets alcoholism is a response to everything he has been put through. The way to help each individual addict through their struggle is to have them understand it\u2019s not forever and their abuse of drugs is entirely situational to their circumstances; drug abuse to the point of self harm is a response to a deeper issue. We\u2019re arguing over a condition (disease vs choice) that does not exist because the thing in which we are trying to capture with our words is constantly changing. If the thing in which we are trying to capture is constantly changing and cannot be replicated, than it doesn\u2019t fit into the scientific method and therefore cannot be considered a disease in the eyes of medical science.

They interact with each other differently depending on your play style. You can make choices that influence these interactions and effect the story\u2019s plotlines (mercy kill a soldier or let him bleed out, capture or execute a group of machine-gunners who killed civilians, stop or ignore an allied squadron committing war crimes, share your limited resources with a starving family or take their meager supplies, looting a museum for priceless art, give one of your precious cigarettes to a kid in exchange for information, trust a soldier who claims to be switching sides but could be leading you into a trap, etc). How you play can also get you promoted in rank, which increases skills and gives you higher ration amounts at base camps. \n\nEach character only has 1 life. Once killed, they're gone forever. You don't recover health by hiding for 10 seconds. If injured you can either be healed by a medic or you have to keep fighting until the skirmish is over. \n\nResources are extremely limited. You have to worry about everything: health, starvation, dehydration, exposure to the elements, and supplies of ammo, explosives, food, water, medical supplies, cigarettes, alcohol, etc. You can find things along the way and stock up at base camps. You get a certain amount of rations and money. You can collect certain items when out in the world to sell/barter at basecamps for more supplies and weapon upgrades.",

This hopefully encourages people to post and participate in the contest. **There will be 10 creddits for gold given out!**\n\nKeep in mind that it does not matter how popular the submission was when it was posted, the winners will only be determined by votes in this thread! However, nominations must be of posts with greater than 5 upvotes. This makes it a lot easier on us.\n\nThe thread will be placed in contest mode - scrambling the post order. Please take the time to read through submissions!\n\nThe categories for this year's brainstorm will be:\n\n1. Most Innovative Idea\n\n2. Most Useful Idea\n\n3. Funniest Idea\n\n4. Best Implemented Idea (An idea that was carried further than just a self-post!)\n\n5. Worst Idea (Couldn't be implemented, should belong in /r/crazyideas)\n\nSome Rules:\n\n1. **Only one nomination per user**\n2. **The nominated post must have greater than 5 upvotes**\n3. **Any inconsistencies in voting or problems with the contest will be sorted out by the discretion of the moderators**\n\n***The contest will run until the 15th of January***\n\nBest,\n\nheld818",

            "selftext": "Don't steal my idea, I might make a million dollars off of it someday! JK. But just bc a person eats an occasional slice of pizza (or a whole pizza if that's your thing) or any other food that's seen as or actually isn't healthy for you doesn't mean they automatically don't care about nutrition. You don't taste the added vitamins in cereal, so why should you if it were to be added to the dough in pizza (both are grainy foods so in theory sounds like it would be easy to figure out). Edit: This could be done with your favorite food if vitamins could be added in some way, it doesn't have to be junk food specifically. FAQs: Why not just take a vitamin supplement? Not everyone likes taking vitamin supplements and many people who should don't (not saying everyone needs to.) Wouldn't that be expensive? No, it shouldn't be, vitamin fortified cereals are inexpensive. But no one in America actually needs vitamins/vitamin supplements? I'm thinking the audience would be mostly people living in poverty (making it shouldn't cost much, fortified cereals are cheap,) people in other countries who can't afford to eat much/healthy, people with eating disorders that restrict their eating, picky eaters, people with digestion disorders, and health conscious people who are having pizza (or any other food you could add vitamins to) for a meal (probably rarely) and know they aren't getting the vitamins and nutrients they normally would had they eaten a healthier meal made of whole foods. You might also find this link interesting: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kelly-dorfman/vitamin-deficiency_b_1633446.html It gives a list of common nutritional deficiencies in the US and explains how \"There is a cultural myth that nutritional deficiencies are rare in Western countries.\" http://www.cdc.gov/nutritionreport/pdf/4Page_%202nd%20Nutrition%20Report_508_032912.pdf",

            "selftext": "TLDR: Groups of strangers get sent off into the woods for a month to survive. They can do anything they want, including raiding and whatnot. Cash prize for the most successful camp at the end of the month. \n\nHey! I know this is a bit long, but I think I have to do it that justice to properly explain it. Basically it's a kind of combination of Hunger Games, Survivor and Sid Meier's Civ. Kind of. All this is open to ideas, so please speak up if you have some.\n\nOk, so here's the gist: several teams of 10-20 people each are sent off into different remote locations (still near to each other though, maybe a couple miles) in an isolated setting like forest or jungle or something. All they're given are cameras and the clothes on their backs.  They have a month to develop and maintain 'camps', or small villages for each team. They can use any skills they have (survival, construction, hunting, whatever) to make whatever they need (shelter, fire, water, food, into more complex things). The goal is to have the most successful camp, scored off a panel of judges/announcers. Everyone in the winning camp is awarded money. Beyond this, you still want to both survive and make the month as comfortable as possible.\n\nNow, here's the interesting part: all of them can try to destroy and pillage the other teams' things, and defend their own things from others. They can attack, plunder, and destroy all they want (actual man-to-man might be tricky because of injury, but I'd say bruising would be a good line). Do they concentrate on developing themselves, or try to take what they can get?\n\nAnd the drama that would arise would make it tv worthy: when you have 20 people who don't know each other forced to band together in a survival setting for a cash reward, especially with the pressures of outsiders and forming a government/making decisions from scratch, people are bound to get pretty antsy. Will relationships form? Will someone leave their team in frustration? Will the leading camp get taken down by a nasty night raid? I don't know either, but it'll all be caught on camera.\n\nSo yeah, I don't know if it'd be at all possible, but hey. I would watch it like nothing else if it existed, and if I knew how I would totally pitch it. Anyone have any opinions?",

The server can forward the data to all the connected clients. I have done this for video, here is the git repo [*realtime-video*](https://github.com/sourabh2k15/hackinout_webRTC) . The server is nodejs based and uses socket.io for realtime data to and fro . We can then host this app on a raspi.\n\nHow do you like the idea ?  also  do you think this project is worth asking a kickstarter support ?",

But even some buildings got swept away.\n\n1st the warning system: We should invent something cheap but practical physically which is anchored near the beach and will wail like a klaxon when a tsunami wave is approaching. I'm picturing a long vertical thing where near the bottom (where normal waves don't push) if it starts getting pushed that force will go up the object and sound a klaxon. So it wouldn't be electronic, it'd just be physics at work.\n\nEscape towers: So dotted near the beach are skeleton spiral staircases on a deep strong pole. At the top is a \"bumper boat\" which is secured to the pole. But if it gets knocked off the pole it floats and is extremely sturdy. This has emergency water and first aid.\n\nThe bumper boat also has ropes and ropes with harnesses for throwing to people unable to climb the ladder in time.\n\nEscape pods: elderly and small children maybe can't climb stairs of the towers or even stairs of hotels. For these there would be tsunami escape pod stations. People would jump into these spherical pods and close the hatch. These pods float and are airtight. They are weighted so that the \"bottom\" always self corrects and keeps the \"up\" part pointing up. The pod might spin head over heels, but it eventually settles with the top pointing up. This is key because at the top is the air hole which can be opened or closed by the occupant. It also has a snorkel which can be pushed out. These pods need to be strong enough to withstand crushing forces because they'll likely get squeezed between cars and homes. So as strong as possible while still being able to float. They have a gadget to make loud noises so rescuers can find them if they get trapped underneath rubble.\n\nThese should really be used only for elderly or children, so, honor system.\n\nObviously these can't be built along the entire coast of every nation. I'm thinking just near beach villages and tourist resorts in the Indian ocean where the 2004 tsunami hit.\n\nWhat do you think of my idea?\n",

It\u2019s hard to get any change, especially when it\u2019s a boring procedural change. \n\nBut I think that there may be a unique opportunity in the next few months. If Donald Trump doesn\u2019t win the Republican nomination and decides to run as an independent, all of the people who traditionally are very strongly opposed to any kind of change would become IRV\u2019s biggest advocates. Trump\u2019s supports will understand that their biggest obstacle will be people\u2019s unwillingness to spoil their vote. If they were pitched IRV as \u201cspoil-free voting\u201d they might put a lot of pressure on their state legislatures. \n\nYou may have noticed that I said **state** legislatures. That because [the states get to decide the rules that bind their electoral college delegates]( https://www.quora.com/Would-IRV-instant-runoff-voting-be-compatible-with-the-Electoral-College). If someone really wanted to see IRV become a thing in the US, They could probably throw enough money in to a small conservative state (Nevada for example) to get a IRV instituted. And that would then serve as a proof-of-concept to other states. \n\nThoughts?\n",

Clearly drones have an advantage for patrolling clear, shallow coastal waters for sharks and other hazards; but they lack a way to warn surfers and swimmers of the dangers.  \n\nPeople in the water can't see because of the glare off the surface, the angle is just wrong to see a shark that might just be feet away.  \n\nI propose equipping the drone with a colored smoke bomb that can be activated remotely.  The drone only has to hover over the shark/jellyfish/whatever and spew red smoke.  All the swimmers and surfers would be able to see this much more easily and get away from the area or back to shore.\n\nA more permanent picket system could be used in shark-prone areas.  A buoy with a tethered helium balloon could hold a camera and smoke bomb aloft for much longer than a drone and have a nearly permanent presence over beaches prone to hazards.",

For example, meeting Taylor Swift fans by going to her concert is a good idea because everyone there is a swiftie. But what if you wanted to connect with swifties at your school or while on the go?\n\nSo, I built a simple iPhone app that shows who in your proximity has matching interests (hashtags) with you. #Near for iPhone is social discovery based on hashtags in your proximity and I believe it could change the way we socialize.\n\n[App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/near/id1023642826?ls=1&mt=8)\n\nPlease, try it out and share your feedback with me so I can make it better.

To apply for a mission, you must state where and when you are available (i.e. Your Hometown on 17th of June from 10am-1pm).\n\nIf two agents are available for a mission at the same time/place, they are paired. One is the cat, one is the mouse.\n\nThe mouse arrives in the area (best played in a public area, like town) earlier than the cat. Once the cat arrives, both players are given a notification the other is ready. \n\nThe aim of the game is for the mouse to evade the cat, but remain in the play area until the time is up. I'm not sure what the cat's job would be (Get the briefcase, touch the mouse, record the mouses actions [enter shop, leave shop, sit at fountain, get food etc.], get close to the mouse etc.), but they would have to remain undetected.\n\nThe cat is given a picture or description of the mouse, but the mouse has to guess who the cat is through people watching. \n\nYou get points at the end of your game saying how well you did, and those points go towards your agent score on the leaderboards. At the higher ranks you get to choose a one-word agent nickname (Iris, Gold, Kipler, Grieg, Coda, Silva etc.).\n\nThere could possibly be company-hosted games every so often in big cities that give extra points.\n\nHow does this all sound?

            "selftext": "So, all Paintball Activity Centre's I've been to have been fairly similar. They consist of four or five games played throughout the day in different arenas. There are about 25 people per team. One shot and you're out of the match.\n\nNow, here's what I propose:\n\nLarge, open, wooded area. Only one. Only two teams for the entire day. Each team consists of 100-200 people. You are shot at until you retreat with your hand in the air (or lie down with your hands on your head). Even then, you're not out, you're simply requesting a break. Each team has various bases around the play area, the match lasts all day.\n\n\nA marshall is positioned in each base, and many are scattered around the course. There are also vantage points and lookout towers and other buildings scattered around aswell as ammo supplies.\n\nPossible Game Modes:\n\nCapture\n\nThe aim of the game is to claim bases. Lets say each team has five bases. It is up to the teams themselves to decide tactics before the game for capturing eachothers base. If you are in a base and you get shot, you must leave and go to another. Each player has a dogtag, and to claim a base you must empty it of the opponent, and scan your dog tag. This then changes the team who occupies the base to you. Whichever team has the most bases at the end wins.\n\nThe Flag\n\nIn the centre of the course there is a marshall with flags. The aim is to get the flag back to your base. If you are retreating and you hold a flag, you must drop it. Whoevere has the most flags at the end wins.\n\nAssassin\n\nEach team elects twenty generals from their men (randomly or use marshalls as the generals). One stays in each of their bases, and the remaining fifteen wander the course. The goal is to take out all of the other teams captains. Whichever team does this first is the winner.\n\nTraitors\n\nTwenty team members switch teams and must remain hidden. The team must then deduce which among them are the ten traitors. In order to accuse someone, you must swipe eachothers dogtags. If you accuse wrongly, you lose one of five points. When all five points are gone you must leave the game. If accused correctly, that member is then ejected from the game.\n\n---\n\nOpinions? Any and all of these gamemodes and things can be edited if you see flaws/improvements",

            "selftext": "I really think that in the world we live in, the only voices that have echoes are the ones of political leaders and high placed intellectuals, the majority of society is either silent, either not listened to, either ignored, and anyone who tries to question major widely accepted ideas is considered a hippie conspiracy theorist, well... that's just my point of view; and everyone follows a political party, which means, along with \"neutral\" national news, the only medias he follows are related in a way or another to the political party he follows, which means he listens to one major opinion that he blindly follows(I am sorry if this description doesn't fit you, I know I can not generalize). So now, let's get into the core of the subject. I know that many people express their opinions over the internet via blogs, forums, YouTube channels and such, but the problem with these is that they aren't just over the internet, but more like all over the internet, we don't really have a platform for opinion discussions like we do have Instagram for pictures and YouTube for videos; so the idea of a user generated newspaper popped into my brain months ago, but it stayed a vague idea in a corner of my head, until I decided to developed because I was bored as hell, but before detailing further about that you have to note some things:\n\nI can not create this website myself, the only HTML I know is the one I learned in middle school, and nor do I have the time to learn how to do it at this time, so if anyone here decided to \"steal\" my Idea, you're welcome\n\nSo here are some details \n\n**How would it work?**\n\nLike any web 2.0 website, users would generate content and interact with each other. It would be non-profit and free, no ads(I couldn't add ads to my website if I'm creating it to fight media corruption)   \n\n**What kind of content?**\n\nIt would support news and actualities as long as they are supported by huge evidence, lying once would ban you forever, but that's not in anyway the point of the website, the content it would mainly support is opinion exchange, the website as a whole would be completely neutral, nothing is banned as long as it does not go against site wide rule like pornography, pedopornography, copyright infringement, etc.. The conversations would rather be civilized with no direct insult, I really have no will to create a huge version of a YouTube comments war. Though every kind of conversation is allowed in the many categories the website would offer, so if you want to discuss who should win the presidential elections, do it, and if you want to discuss what black guy should this Kardashian fuck next, well.. don't count on me to upvote... but still, nothing is stopping you from doing it. Most formats would be allowed, pictures(Like caricatures, graphic representations, etc.), video, and of course text posts, or even books.\n\n**Interactions**\n\n \n***voting systems***\n\n\n*Content quality*\n\n\nThe user would upvote/downvote based on the quality of the post, this would be the most important voting system on the website as it would eventually get the post on the hot/front/callitwhateveryouwant page, and it would give the poster points(Downvotes would not make him loose points though), these points would make him rise, from \"user\" to \"journalist\" to \"top journalist\", etc. and depending on this \"flair\" he'd be able to access features like creating his \"journalist\" blog linked to the website, kind of a tumblr blog linked to tumblr, or create his own \"inner\" online newspaper along with other journalists.\n\n*The opinion itself*\n\nYou would just say if you are with or against the opinion, it wouldn't in anyway possible influence anything, so why would I add this option? for a very simple reason, imagine you read a very well written text post you don't agree with, if you only had the first option you'd automatically downvote the post even though you find it well written, but if you had both options, you'd upvote one and downvote the other.\n\n***Commenting***\n\nYou could comment directly with a non customizable text only post, or create an independent post by tagging the later one if you intend answering by a long organized blog-like post, a picture or video.\n\n**Why exactly I want this thing to exist**\n\nI explained it at the beginning but just as a recapitulation, Even though political pluralism exists, every opinion is shared in the circle of it's partisans, we don't really see huge opinions facing each other in everyday life, and no I don't want to create an online opinions chaos, this website would make every opinion shared with everyone not within the span of the people who support the guy who shared it, this way we would stop following leaders blindly(I repeat, I can't generalize I know that, and I'm sorry) and start being a little more open minded, even if opinions are freely shared over the internet they are very spread appart and we don't see them together, the first objective of this website would be grouping these together.\n\n  \n",

            "selftext": "My biggest struggle as an American voter and citizen is how difficult it is to get a complete, inclusive view of the current scientific, religious, and political understandings on a politically-charged issue.  As the American public becomes more and more politically polarized, I find that misinformation and mudslinging becomes louder and more prevalent. \n\nI think there would be some value in creating a show in which all the current evidence around a particular social issue can be brought into one place and evaluated logically in a controlled environment.  It would use charismatic debaters and audience participation to help build an audience, inform the voting public, and teach people at large how to use logic to evaluate an argument.  With luck, it would begin to sway people toward well-considered viewpoints on political issues.  With a lot of luck, it would put misunderstanding based views around issues like vaccination to bed for good. \n\nAn issue of political and social importance, such as abortion, is chosen for a series of debates.  Every \u201cside\u201d of the issue chooses a team of researchers and logicians and a mouthpiece to speak for them and provide entertainment value.  The debaters create rules, and these can change for each issue, that determine what constitutes an acceptable precept from which logical derivations can be made.  Based on, and determined by, these rules, the first round, in which each side accepts and rejects possible precepts occurs.  Once the precepts are set, and with guidance from the researchers, the mouthpieces begin debating, focusing on arguments that are acceptable under Aristotelian logic.  While this is happening, impartial judges track chains of logic, force concessions of points (which become new precepts), and identify logical fallacies.  Commentators and on-screen graphics help the audience to follow what\u2019s happening.  New research and other appropriate new precepts can be entered into the discussion at any point in order to further inform the discussion, and old arguments can even be opened up again years down the line if new information becomes available.\n\nThe television audience is invited to take part in regular polls in order to track changes in viewer opinion based on the debate, and reddit threads will be set up for each side so that strong points that might not have occurred to the experts can be voted to the top and influence the debate.  There will also be a forum where audience members can share pathos-heavy anecdotes about their own struggles with the issue, which can be read on air and become part of the debates, so that debaters can acknowledge the human sides of the issue and diffuse fallacies that might arise from emotional appeals.\n\nEveryone believes that his or her political opinion is the only one that makes any sense.  This would force people to acknowledge the rationales behind competing opinions and look at the blind spots they were pretending didn\u2019t exist.  And people\u2019s commitment to their own perspectives should keep them watching, as everyone wants to be proved right.\n\nHell, I\u2019d watch it.",

            "selftext": "Modern society has been pretty good with dealing with a myriad of problems. From working conditions, disease, hunger and Human rights for the most part we have an amazing track record. That being said it never hurts to do more good things and a good societal deficit we have now is mental health. For all our accomplishments we can\u2019t enjoy them to the fullest due to not being the best we can be mentally and emotionally. I believe therapy or cognitive behavioural therapy is the next big issue to tackle that will enrich our lives much in the same way the discovery of penicillin has swept away the ominous veil of disease and the isolation of Nitrogen has dramatically solved the hunger problem. \n\n\nWhat I propose is an on demand Psychotherapy service that anyone can access on the phone to talk with a qualified psychiatrist when they need it. Psychiatrists shall be recruited from countries with lower wages to make the service affordable but at the same time provide relatively competitive wages to those hired. Psychiatry need not only be a resource to the rich. In fact, for each session you do you provide a free session for a person of your choice and 2 sessions donated to someone in a third world country. \nAs things get rolling some psychiatrists will be more in demand than others. In this situation prices will be adjusted to accommodate supply and demand and keep the star therapists on board helping people (and occasionally being assigned randomly to a star user). \n\n\nMy goal is to make psychiatry a regular everyday occurrence just like how we view exercise or dieting. If done right, it is a healthy preventative measure ensuring a more satisfying life and at worse a fix. Either way I don\u2019t see a negative effect to society if all goes well. \n",

I have always been a very casual gamer, but always felt that the degree of strategy and resource development employed by gamers is sometimes better than those of many of my professional counterparts.\n\nThere are many more details that I have been hashing out via a Google Doc, such as mitigating risks and such, but I need help.\n\n1) I have no game programming knowledge. My background is the other side of this idea (social and economic development, humanitarian, policy, etc.).\n\n2) This idea is nuts with a lot of gaps and potential issues that need to be addressed. I need someone to help me further hash it all out, call me crazy, and then prove I am crazy after exhausting the idea.\n\n3) Motivation. If someone else was involved then I may be more motivated to work on it more regularly.\n\nI know outlets exist for game developers who are interested in real-world applications, but I have no idea how to tap into them. The current organization that I am contracted with (Save the Children) is working with Gaming for Good, so I am cross-posting from there after no feedback. However, this is an independent endeavor, so I cannot use the organization directly to feed into partners.\n\nThoughts? Ideas? Downvotes?\n\nThank you!",

What would really tell the story would be a dashboard, like an excel spreadsheet line, that gave stats on a few key areas. \n\nWho introduced it?\nTotal Co-Sponsors?\nRepublican Co-Sponsors?\nDemocratic Co-Sponsors?\nOther Party Co-Sponsors?\nPlan Title:\nPlan Description: (Link to long description if needed)\n((Here is where it gets interesting for Americans))\nTaxpayer Dollars Spent So Far Working on Bill:\nWill the President Sign?: Approve/Veto/Leaning Approve/Leaning Veto\n(If Veto or Veto Lean)Taxpayer Dollars Spent After Veto Likely given:\n\nYou know, things that should be clear and \"transparent\" to citizens. Like a very clear and open example of Taxpayer Dollars being spent. In real time, or updated nightly. \n\nA couple of script monkeys could mock that up in a few days at most, likely a couple hours. All of the data fields above are pretty much available 24-7 already, and with a little effort, a few data folks would be able to find a quick way to calculate the Taxpayer Dollars being spent. This could be stood up in a few months with the right people. And I imagine it would be one of the most visited government web site pages. \n\nFrom there, you could branch out easily to dashboards for other things. \n\nAgain, with the right people, this would not take a whole lot to implement. Let the crew do the work, get other people to stand behind them and do the paperwork as needed, but stay back to let them finish quickly.\n\nIn love and Transparency,\n[name redacted]",

            "selftext": "Hello!\n\nI (like many) very much enjoy playing the classic TTT game mode on the popular steam game Garry's Mod. Recently I have been having some issues with my computer and an idea sprung to mind. \n\nWhy hasnt there been a TTT type mode made for consoles? I mean, I know its possible, with 16 people a game thats 3 traitors and a detective and thats a good balance. I know its technologically possible, with huge games like GTA V, Just Cause 3 and Fallout 4, why cant we have a vanilla TTT game? Id easily pay \u00a320-\u00a330 for a whole TTT game, now im not saying it has to have custom items and a gazillion playermodels, or amazing graphics, in fact I feel like the poor graphics makes it more fun due to it feeling like an old game. All we would need is around 7-10 small maps, 5-10 different guns (Glock, H.U.G.E, Shotgun, Rifle, M16, UMP45, P228, Galil, and a Deagle), 1-5 playermodels, and a few interfaces for detective and traiter and you have your game, with the correct advertising I can guarantee it would sell well.\n\nNow obviously you wouldnt be able to straight up rip it from Gmod, you would need to change it up a bit, make the guns look different and rename them, new maps, different playermodels and maybe even a different backbone, like your on a holiday and there are murders about, and theres one undercover cop or something, changing it up but keeping the same concept, I think it would be very successful.\n\nI have little experience with modelling and coding, so thats what I need help with, but I can be the trailer editor and creative director. It would be an equal split of profit. \n\nThe only issue is I think due to microsofts policys, it may have to be a PS4 exclusive, microsoft charges fees for each game update you see so it would need to be perfect before we release it on there.\n\nI would highly appreciate any help/feedback I get, hope you like my idea!\n\nThanks,\n\nJoel",

Also, I can't imagine someone else hasn't already thought of this, so if it goes by another name please educate me.\n\nThe idea works with Reaganomics or Trickle Down Economics. The idea that as people get richer they put money back into the economy and create jobs which help everybody get richer. Except  it doesn't seem to work that way. Instead the rich seem to horde their cash, and the rich get richer while the poor get poorer. \n\nSo, my idea is that you force them to spend their money. Basically if you make so much money a year, your wealth is audited and you're given an amount of money you have to spend every year. This would be proportionate to the amount of money you make, and it would take into consideration anything you own so that you can replace anything that's damaged. This would then force you to put money back into the economy. \n\nThe reason I think this would be preferable is because it still allows a measure of freedom and all the rewards of hard work, while still redistributing wealth.\n\nHow economically sound is this?

            "selftext": "Morality is baseline the same for every being - though not everyone's action are moral, we can find that there are things most or majority of people will find moral. Examples of such things are mostly found in holy books (also philosophical), but because they are associated with religious movement, people tend to throw a way an explanation of why a specific behavior is/should be considered bad.  \n      \nWhat if an internet community (such as reddit) confronted moral questions submitted by its users and by doing so created a dogma-free collective moral spine? Of course explanations given should be strictly philosophical - no dogma allowed, but existence of God/higher being/a source should be allowed. Religious explanation could be allowed in case the reasoning is shared with other religions.\n  \nReasoning behind the idea? All religions are built upon a wisdom of a man. Buddhism was created after Buddha died, Christianity was built upon the teachings of Jesus, Islam - Mahomet. Judaism had many prophets and there is a similar issue with Hinduism. There is no community known to man that exists without believing in something - it is our nature (http://www.salon.com/2007/01/31/king_38/)  \n  \nWhy is it needed? Well, there are things that some of us **decide** not to do, like e.g. eating meat and we could say that every man has different reasoning to do so. But in reality all of these people do it because of our empathy to the animals - we do not wish anyone death as we all fear it. You can say that someone does so because of a dogma (reincarnation) as such prohibition exists solely in Hinduism - but the truth is, all the teachings called for respecting another being's life (e.g. \"Thou shalt not kill\"). Also, our conscience should be considered an indicator as words are in fact very limiting - many people had a situation they could not describe with any words. Also a conscience is a part of our psyche which means it is responsible for our mental health.   \n  \nSo how would it look like? Well, there could be a subreddit where you would ask a question and wait till redditors answer on it. After that the most up-voted post would be chosen - it should be the most informative (e.g. linking research) - and then put into Q&A sheet. It could work out the other way if there a better one (not limiting to reddit?).  \n  \nHere's an example of such Question: Is it moral to terminate pregnancy?  \nAnswer 1: No it is not, as such action affects mother's mental health which is why we can establish that conscience tells us not to do such thing. (http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/1981-24131-001).  \nAnswer 2: Yes, it is, but no longer after 3 months of pregnancy - by then the fetus develops nervous system (http://www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/fetal-brain-nervous-system/) which is responsible for *feeling* stimuli and then replying to it - meaning it is conscious. And by that point, you would kill a being.  \nAnswer 3: Yes, if it's yours, you can do with it anything you want - you can put a dog to sleep which isn't truly yours so why couldn't you decide on that matter?  \n  \n  \nThoughts? Is it even possible to create such a thing?",

            "selftext": "Thirty-five people are tossed into a house. Yes, thirty-five people. Grand prize for winning: $100,000. They all get a thousand credits they can give to whom they please. If they win, every credit is worth a hundred dollars. How many credits one has is private to them and unable to be confirmed outside of their own word-of-mouth. (ie: no \"See, it says I still have 990 left!\") These can be given, traded, etc. but in the end, only the WINNER's credits will count for redemption of prize money. At the end of every episode, however, current credit counts will be revealed (of only the people still in the house).\n\nAfter a day of living together, they all vote for the first loser.\n\nThe loser is escorted to another house.\n\nThirty four people remain. The next day, they all, as individuals, get to talk to the evictee. Money offerings, deal, discussion on alliances, etc. are all done. Giving credits to losers is permissible, they can win a share of your prize winnings, if you give it to them. Also note: it's permitted to give someone else's credits to somebody. The credits are indistinguishable, so people have to be careful with the storage of credits (they'll have their own vault with a bunch of bags to distinguish who gave them what, but the vaults will be opened during the voting for counting and removal of the losers' credits)\n\nThen, the evictee chooses someone to be the next loser. They go to the house with him.\n\n33 players, two losers.\n\nThe next day, everybody can go talk to the evictees, in private 1 on 1 or in the public them-with-all-evictees. Only one player gets to enter the loser house at a time, so it's up to the losers to tell the players what happened inside.\n\nOnce everybody's talked, both the losers choose a unique person. Two people will lose, each chosen by a prior loser.\n\n31 people remain, 4 losers.\n\nYou can probably guess where this is going.\n\nDiscussion, four new losers.\n\n27 players, eight losers. Most of the losers should now have a stake in some player's game. If you lose, you get the choice of who gets to continue playing or not, so everyone has to be nice to everybody. A bit of blood on your hands and you're toast.\n\nNow, you might be asking \"do they vote at the same time? how do they not vote the same person?\"\n\nThe losers don't vote at the same time. The \"youngest\" loser (the most recent loser) goes first, then voting progresses in order of seniority (in private, no discussion during voting, they can only vote for people not already evicted). Once a vote is locked in, that person is considered the first evictee of that round, so will be the \"oldest\" out of all the new losers. The first loser of the game will always get to decide who the youngest evictee is.\n\nNow, gameplay continues.\n\nTwenty-seven and eight becomes nineteen and sixteen which becomes, lastly, three and thirty-two.\n\nThree people left. Thirty two evictees.\n\nAll thirty-two people evicted now get to vote for who they think shouldn't win. One last chance to evict someone you hate.\n\nThe winner is the person with the least amount of hate-votes in the end. All the credits that originally belonged to them are transferred into money. They could walk away with a hundred-thousand dollars or none.\n\n---\n\nOptional thing: present games with rewards of more credits, locked under your title (ie: credits that disappear if you lose). You can spend credits to gain advantages in these games. (ie: It may be advantageous to spend 50 of someone else's credits to get forty credits under your name. After all, only your credits matter if you win!)\n\nDoes this make sense? I think it seems super cool, but would need a reasonably large budget to do.\n\nMaybe it could be easier if it was themed, say, at a Summer Camp so that everyone can have their own private quarters, a social game area and a place to talk with the losers (the campfire, maybe? idk)\n\nI just want this game to become a reality, one tiny misstep and you're gone the next episode.\n\nThere could be a 20-episode season with\n\nEntrance - Game - Vote - Game - Deals - Vote - Game - Deals - Vote - ... - Last Eviction - Deals - Final Vote\n\nI've thought too much about this, but I can't stop thinking about how awesome this seems!",

            "selftext": "Alternate title I'm considering is simply \"Who Is Best Girl.\" There's a huge following of my fellow nerds who like to debate which of their favorite characters would win in a fight, and even the wildly successful Death Battle series from Screwattack making some of these match-ups come to life. What I'm suggesting is essentially a beauty pageant-esque series comparing and rating female characters from various works of fiction (TV, movies, video games, etc) in terms of Looks, Feats, Personality, and \"Waifu Potential,\" scoring them to find out with very little bias who is the best overall female character in the work, or, put simply, \"best girl.\"  \n\nThe format would be narration by me, focused on comedy as well as interesting trivia about these characters, with short clips and images of the characters being discussed next to an overlay describing key attributes and displaying the determined rating out of 5 in each of the aforementioned categories.  \n\nI'd welcome any comment or criticism, and would especially like to know if a channel like this already exists that I wasn't able to find during my preliminary search for stuff like it.

Users have individual pages like Facebook, but there are also \"Clubs\" that have the same role as subreddits? \n\n\"Why?\" Because not only could people follow their friends and converse with their own circles of friends, but they could also search for communities like here. Users could choose to use it for communication with their own friends or the world at large, because *both* have the tools provided for it. \n\nOn a technical side, there could be a special \"smart sub\" for friends. Unlike the normal subs that behave much like Reddit, the viewers in this sub would only see posts from the people they follow, even if that post belongs in an actual sub. \n\n---\nDo you guys see this working or catching on? I've never built any kind of a site, but I'd like to see this for real.",

Not many people use geocaching or letter boxing here so I thought it would be a cool idea to create some type of hunt around my town.

A type of scavenger hunt, riddle, clue, etc...idea...Anything is worth discussing so if you have an idea, please share!

            "selftext": "One problem with organizing small, short term events within your social circle is that people are only willing to participate as long as there is a minimum amount of people present, or at least some people that they already know. This is to avoid the awkward four persons party with people you don't know very well.\nAlso, people don't want to commit themselves to come before they are sure about this because they cannot default afterwards as it would be an implicit acknowledgement that they aren't comfortable with the people who've also agreed to go (Do you see what I'm talking about or am I just being weird?)\n\nSo if you try to organize this with facebook for example, the go-to strategy people adopt is to wait that enough people have agreed to attend the event before they also agree. You can see how this doesn't work at all. In the end the event doesn't take place even though there were enough people willing to attend it. This a typical coordination failure. \n\nOne solution could be to start acting honestly and try to overcome our social anxieties. My solution however would be to create an app/website that lets you organize private polls, similar to doodle.com except that it would be anonymous. Here's how it would work\u00a0:\n1. You respond to the invitation by saying whether you want to attend or not. If yes you state your conditions\u00a0: required number of people and/or \u00ab\u00a0I come if this person comes\u00a0\u00bb. You don't see who else has voted or what they have voted.\n2.  When the poll is closed, an email is sent to the people whose conditions are satisfied with the names of the other people who will also attend. The names of the people whose conditions weren't satisfied aren't displayed to anybody.\n3. The party happens, this is great, everybody's happy.\n\nWhat do you think\u00a0?",

I think we can borrow from the \"Hazard Diamond\" in creating a new, clearer, more informative rating system for films.  \n  \nhttps://riskmanagement.unt.edu/riskman/Images/hazardDiamond.jpg - Hazard Diamond  \n  \nWhat I'd like to see is a pentagon-shaped shield displaying a 1-5 rating (5 being the most intense content) for the following five content categories: Violence & Gore, Substance Abuse, Sex & Nudity, Profanity, and Adult Themes. They'd be color-coded for easy at-a-glance reference, and totaled in the center to provide an easy 1-25 rating of the overall level of adult content. This would remove some (unfortunately not all) rating biases and put decision-making in the hands of the parents. As far as restricting children, just put a ban on young children from buying/seeing anything with a 3 or higher in one category, and teenagers under 17 from seeing anything with a 4 or higher. A rating of 5 would be reserved for the most extreme cases of splatter films, 300 F-bomb curse-fests, and softcore pornography.  \n  \nhttp://imgur.com/8GPyN4Z - Rate-agon  \n  \nOf course I know this'll never happen, but wouldn't it be nice to know more about the content up front and be able to make an informed decision, rather than being scared out of or shamed into seeing something?",

            "selftext": "I thought of this today but realized I can't pitch unsolicited ideas to disney as they will not take it for whatever reason but this could really sell. It would basically be a multiplayer platform combat game resembling super smash Bros but with disney characters and maps! It could possibly add a story mode where you travel through different disney worlds and fight whatever foes related to the disney world and maybe even include boss battles and after the boss battles unlocking those characters. But the main multiplayer premise would be arena 2d style fighting platform. And also with marvel and star wars being under the big entertainment name, I think this would be a very good idea. Also the competitive advantage to smash Bros would be that it wouldn't have to be strictly Nintendo and could possibly be compatible for Xbox, ps4, pc. I really hope they make a game like this but I can't do nothing about it due to their strict idea suggestion policy. Who else would be interested in this?",

Why don't some of the people who moderate college debate competitions moderate political debates? Professionals wouldn't favor certain candidates, wouldn't allow anyone to talk over their time limit, wouldn't allow candidates to dodge questions, and would maintain order if it becomes a catfight.

But what if there was a system where you give one \"provote\" to your favorite candidate, and an \"antivote\" to the candidate you hate the most. Then the candidate with the best ratio of provotes to antivotes would win. \n\nYou'd need at least 3 major candidates. For example, if Donald Trump, Jeb Bush, Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton, and Jim Webb were all running, Trump and Clinton would obviously get a ton of antivotes, and so would Bush and Sanders. Hardly anyone cares about Jim Webb, so he wouldn't get many antivotes. But maybe he also wouldn't get some minimum number of provotes to win. So the winner would end up being either Jeb Bush or Bernie Sanders. \n\nOr maybe a system like this would encourage enough people to cast their provotes for a centrist, and Jim Webb would actually win. \n\nI'm sure could use some fine tuning, and might cause some mediocre candidates to get elected, but our government is so dysfunctionally full of charismatic obstructionists right now that no compromises ever happen and nothing gets done. \nThis just came to me.

Checkout the awesome experience.\n\nURL: http://playground.layupcloud.com\nUsername: **user**\nPassword: **demo**\n\nNavigate to Learning -> Courses on the top menu and try out the \"Career Development - Leadership\" course.\n\nThrough this, I hope to disrupt the traditional MBA model by providing unlimited access to things you like to learn, from freely available content at low cost. \n\nDisclaimer: I am one of the founders of LayUp - the platform used in the demo. Also, I checked with the YouTube ToS, before posting.\n\n**I've also setup a small survey to leave comments - http://goo.gl/forms/8dv9WwF6oq**",

The topic is hot, many people are actually watching the numbers go down [live](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq8E7CWATlk) and given the popularity and addictiveness of cookie clickers it seems like possibly a great idea to combine these two.\n\nUnfortunatelly I don't know anything about programing or hosting said clicker. I only found [a tool](http://orteil.dashnet.org/experiments/idlegamemaker/help) where you can customize the cookie clicker replacing cookies, but I don't think this would allow reversing the process. Basically it would have to start at very high number and then with every click you would go down, buying upgrades to decrease numbers faster etc.\n\nSo, if someone out there has the knowledge of setting something like this up, let me know and I'll be happy to throw in some ideas. You don't even have to give me credit, as I would only like to see this done and I really think this is an opportunity for some programmers to gain recognition :)",

This causes the baby to swallow air and can cause colic.\n\nThere are many modern milk bottles that have valves and the like in them in an attempt to let air back into the bottle when the milk is draining.  \n\nMy idea goes back to nature ^^^^TM\n\nIt is simply a case of designing a milk bottle that has a bladder in it similar to [this.](http://images.sportsdirect.com/images/imgzoom/78/78704501_xxl.jpg)\n\nSo, in my head, the bottle would still be made of plastic, all though it will have gaps in it and the plastic will be much softer (like those really bendy rulers that were popular in school a while ago).  Inside the bottle would be the bladder which would be full of milk and a standard teat would be attached at the neck of the bottle.  As the milk is drank the bladder would compress.  This is much more like what happens with breast feeding where the sacks of milk compress when they are drained.\n\nThis would eliminate any pressure buildup and it should also eliminate colic.\n\nThe bladder could then be cleaned with a sterilizing solution.\n\nThoughts?\n\n",

            "selftext": "The idea is simple enough: a YouTube-like site that is owned and operated by the people who create the content for it in the style of a [coop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative). They set the rules, vote on who to hire to run the site, and split any leftover profits between content creators.\n\n*Background:* A lot of YouTubers have been complaining of recent about their content being demonetized or deleted by YouTube with no explanation and no effective recourse. Entire channels have even been disappearing. You can watch one video about it [here](https://youtu.be/bC3NIdiZF_E). This has been going on for some time now and has been affecting several channels, including big channels. This tells me that it's a serious problem, and YouTube's general unwillingness to respond to it tells me that they aren't going to solve it any time soon. The best solution, in my mind, is for those affected by the problem to create the solution - an alternative platform which does everything YouTube does, but without having to depend on a detached, disinterested corporate master to use it.\n\n*Challenges:* Obviously, everyone would be operating at a loss for a while. This would be the initial difficulty. There would be an initial investment and it would take some time for viewers and advertisers to switch over. This could be offset with some crowdfunding to help start the project up, or by integrating the site with sites such as [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/). I know I would certainly throw in a few bucks, and I'm poor.",

But taking it further, a room with computer-controlled X-ray lasers, able to make a grid that's adjustable by aiming lasers around vital organs, crisscrossing on points that need to be irradiated. Room set up for MRI or PET scan. As lasers intersect on desired targets, wavelengths are adjusted to constructively interfere so as to boost amplitude exactly at those spots. This way all tissues not at foci will get negligible radiation, while foci will get both multidirectional irradiation and \"hot spots\" like happens in your microwave. Noncancerous cells get far less radiation than cancerous cells. I'm thinking coming at the foci from as many directions as feasible will maximize radiation at target and minimize damage to surrounding tissue. Vulnerable points could have wavelengths adjusted for destructive interference to cancel out amplitude at sensitive spots.\n\nTldr; Improvement on existing design. I picture a lattice of beams intersecting on targets and aiming around vital areas. Adjust interference to be greatest on targets and less on vital areas.\n\nCould potentially be used for noninvasive brain surgery, cauterize brain bleeds.\n\nEdit: building on cyberknife idea, only instead of a pivoting robot, a number of weaker beams and interference control.",

I'm mostly porting features in the game for educational reasons, to see what obstacle might come across in the future.\n\nNow, I'm starting back from scratch because I received terrible feedback from two indie dev communities, mostly because, in its current state, my game is a clone and \"you should be ashamed, not proud, of working on a clone\". Note that the game will **not** be a clone in the end.\n\nAnd I think I had a really cool idea to involve a potential community, help spread the word and makethe game community-driven.\n\nBasically, the idea is to release and **regularly maintain** a \"tech demo\" which will **not** feature the story or have an overworld or any \"game\" features but rather gameplay features.\nFor this explanation to make sence, think Zelda. You play room by room forever, kind of like in infinite runners. In each room, you may encounter _some_ of the enemies (not all of them, I don't want to spoil the final experience by having most of the full game in this \"tech demo\") or a chest will a new item or a boss.\nSimply put, you can _experience the gameplay_ beforehand and send feedback either via automatically collected analytics or via a feedback form.\n\nThis makes it great for me for a lot of reasons: let's be honest, this is free advertising, hype building and feedback. I will also be able to test things out, like change the graphics or test a new weapon out to see if it sticks.\nBut it can also be great for the players, as they will be able to experience the game a lot earlier and get actively involved in the game. Want a new feature? Ask for it, and it will be tested in the next build (togglable, to make sure the experience of the other players isn't diminished by a bad idea).\n\nI will have to \"gamify\" the experience to make sure users don't lose interest. Unlockable stuff like new characters, new weapons, a leaderboard, things like this.\n\nI can do a lot of things around that, test stuff and all, and I really want to include the community in the creation process.\n\nI'm also thinking, though this may be a bad idea, to include ads or a voluntary donation button to help funding things like sound effects or music if the \"testers\" want to get involved in making the game even better. I'm really not sure it's a good idea though.\n\nFrom what I see, there are a few issues with this idea:\n\n* confusion about the project: since it's not a full game but a \"tech demo\", some users may get confused and think this is a full game, which may lead to bad comments\n* burnout: some user might lose interest with the final game if they play the \"tech demo\" for too long before the final game is released, or if the final game takes too long to finish\n\nHowever, I also think it would help motivate me a lot, and would help motivate the community too!\n\n_What do you think?_\n\n**tl;dr**: \"live\" tech demo for gameplay, with ways to send feedback and help making the game better.\n\nFor an analogy: this is like early access, but free and with the game stripped-down to the gameplay only.\n\n[**EDIT**]: added tl;dr, added a few precisions and added the early access analogy.",

            "selftext": "As games get larger, and distribution is more often digital than physical, it's not uncommon for people to spend hours, even days, downloading games they've bought from Steam, Origin, etc.\n\nWhy not design both the games and the distribution system so that firstly the game's executable code is downloaded (usually a relatively small part of the total footprint), followed by the assets (models, textures, music, maps) in the order they are actually required to play the game.\n\nThus, for example, once everything required to play the game's first level has been downloaded (and installed on-the-fly), it would be possible to start playing, while assets which are only referenced in later levels download in the background. If the player reaches a point which requires data that hasn't been downloaded yet, they'd see some kind of loading screen, informing them that they need to wait for the download to complete before continuing.\n\nSince a lot of assets tend to be re-used throughout the game, it might still be necessary to download a lot of data before being able to play even the start of the game. However, even waiting until the download is 50% or 75% complete would be better than 100% with 30+GB games that can take a whole day to download even on broadband.\n\nObviously, this would work best for games with a fairly linear progression, but even some open-world type games could benefit from prioritising downloading of assets for areas near the player's starting location. Alternatively, some games could be prompted by player's in-game choices for download priority.",

            "selftext": "[BEWARE BIG BLOCK OF TEXT INCOMING. SCROLL DOWN FOR TL:DR]\n\nUh, yeah, this is my first time on /r/lightbulb . I really wanted to know what other people thought of this idea. The show takes inspiration from shows like Steven Universe, Adventure Time and Fallout, with a bit of Captain Planet, and maybe Undertale.\n\nThe show is divided into several seasons/arcs. This would be set in something like Pre War Fallout, where technology has also advanced (so basically there's laptops, cellphone, etc.) Similar to Fallout, atomic war blows the whole place to smithereens.\n\nThere would be a team of 5 people (3 girls, two boys). I don't know if the protagonist is a boy or girl tho :P By the end of the show there should be about 9 or 10. I only have 5 character ideas so far, and even then , only three are actually mine. There are also a few ideas that i don't know who to assign to.\n\n* \"Preston\" and \"Piper\", a boy and girl who are often together. In season 5, they will be trapped and will reveal that they are gay and lesbian. Their appearances are based off of the companions of the same name in Fallout, although Piper is shorter and her clothing may be similar to Preston's.\n\n* \"Adam\", a small boy (11-12). Too innocent, precious cinnamon roll, must be protected. Converts \"Nick\" to the team. Begins a reformation into a stronger kid over Season 3.\n\n* \"Nick\" A hitman hired by the antagonists to assassinate the team. Based off of the \"Hitman with a Heart\" Trope. I have two possible personalities for him. Personality 1:He is rather cold and distant. Personality 2: A personality similar to Nick Valentine from Fallout 4. It is revealed that he became a hitman to protect his family. His heart melts for \"Adam\" mostly because he reminds him of his own daughter. He has a film-noire theme.\n\n* \" Rick/Wreck\" : A rebellious teen. Has a steampunk-getup. He has trust issues stemming from an incident from his childhood.\n\n* One of the girls will have a J-Pop Twin tails hairstyle.\n\n* One of the males will become mortally wounded and be uploaded into a derelict robot. I'm mainly leaning towards \"Nick\" ,just for the Fallout reference.\n\nEssentially in this show's universe, there is something akin to a Forced Evolutionary Virus, which creates mutants. The first season is devoted to setting up a comedic setting so I can break it apart. Someone may join in the first season, a pair whose character a friend of mine fleshed out. I'll ask her for permission to use the idea. There could also be a third person who is vital to the second season's plot. (They will be the third person I \"created\") However, the three might just join in the second season during the early parts.\n\nIn the second season, someone is sent to kill them (or a person in the team). This is the fourth person I created. After they are defeated, they are imprisoned. However, \"Adam\" sucessfully converts them into joining the team.\n\nThe third season has several joiners: this time, a team of individuals seen as the \"Anti-Team\". [Steven Universe]( /s \"Similar to Jasper, Peridot and Lapis\") Originally they are sent to kill the entire team (Including \"Nick\" as he has defected). In a two-part episode, an accident spreads apart the teams: one part of the five is stuck with their counterpart. \"Rick\" defects first after he is forced into the team by his counterpart, \"Nick\" and \"Adam\", but not without mortally wounding Nick. Nick is uploaded into a derelict robot similar to a synth in fallout 4. One by one, each of the \"Anti-Team\" is converted, including a scene similar to [Steven Universe] (/s \"Peridot's Redemption\")\n\nThe fourth season reveals the antagonists: a corporation similar to the Institute that creates immoral experiments and started the war \"as an experiment\". It also reveals that it attempted creating superhumans by fusing 2 plus humans together but failed. The reason why \"Nick\" and the \"Anti-Team\" were supposed to kill them was because the protags were messing with their experiments.The show also introduces a biker gang which first acts as a rival, but warms up to them. The biker gang and protagonists discover an abandoned lab, where the failed experiments are kept frozen. The failures break free, and the bike gang fights them off in order to protect the protagonists. One of the members blows the place apart, killing all the failures and all but 1 of the bikers. The biker joins and becomes the one of the last few to join. There will also be a heartbreaking scene where \"Nick\"/the robot man returns to his family.\n\nThe fifth season is just a big countdown to the final battle. The last one to join will be an informant, who knows lots of things about the corporation. In a twist or irony, one by one, the protags will die in reverse order of how they joined. (Informant, then biker, etc.) The lead protag will be cheered on by all his dead comrades and will kill the source of corruption.\n\nAs an alternate ending, maybe we could see what life would be like if no one had died and the Institute hadn't existed in the first place.\n\nTL:DR Season 1: Comedic effect.\n\nSeason 2: Hitman with a heart gets converted by precious cinnamon roll.\n\nSeason 3: Cinnamon roll is tainted, There is now an anti-team who is converted one by one.\n\nSeason 4: Big Bad revealed to be Institute knockoff, biker gang massacre\n\nSeason 5: A big battle with ironic deaths and shippers getting sunk.\n\nWhat have I done , so is this a good idea? What do you think?\n\nEDIT: Removed stuff and added a new line",

After which, they schedule an appointment the next day. before the appointment, they set up a room for you with a TV, a laptop, and free wifi. Throughout the appointment you have no distractions. After the appointment you are allowed to relax for a few minutes until they send an aide. Throughout this period the aide will monitor your heartbeat and ask you questions such as \"how are you feeling\", etc. After this you can choose to have another session (which is shorter) or go home, depending on if you feel better.

            "selftext": "Ok. First I am going to explain why I came up with this thing and why I think it is needed. When I ask people about their favorite movie of all time, I don't expect the answer to be Shawshank Redemption. I know it is a good movie. I mean it is one of those movies that does not have any clear faults. I would give it a 9/10 rating and I usually give ratings between 6-7/10. But, is it your favorite movie of all time. Maybe, but I would be surprised if it is. \n\nShawshank Redemption is a clear example of what I will call \"the common best effect.\" I don't know if there is a scientific term about it so that is why I am going to invent the name. \"The common best effect\" is when something is nobody's favorite thing but it is good enough to be the common best. For instance, Fight Club, which is my favorite movie, does not have this despite being many people's favorite movie. Some people dislike it so much that it compensates and does not allow it to be \"the common best.\" \n\nThe problem with \"the common best\" is that it is almost nobody's favorite but it is the overall favorite.\n\nSo here is my proposal. Have people select a number of movies and make a, let's say, Top 25 or Top 10 movies. Then, distribute the points from 25 to 1 (or 10 to 1) to those movies. Then select the overall favorite. This will generate a better list because people will not be able to give 10/10 to multiple movies which they do not consider equal. They will have to punish \"the common best\" in order to signify their best. \n\nI think this is a better rating system than the current system. What do you think?\n\nP.S. The point of this argument is not Shawshank Redemption of Fight Club. They are just examples.",

My girlfriend is running for president in her university and she is struggling with some ideas. This is what she needs help with:\n\n\"I am running for President in my University's student elections and really need a slogan that will grab people. My name is Grace and I'm finding it difficult to come up with something different and original. Suggestions I've had so far are 'A Saving Grace' and 'Say Grace for President'. I'd love to know what else people can come up with? Also, if you have any ways you can link a physical interaction gimmick with a name pun, that would be great. For example, the woman who ran last term was called Daisy and ran the 'pick a Daisy for President' campaign. For the physical interaction part of her campaign she created giant daisies with holes in the center that had enough room to fit a face. People then had photos with these daisies and they were uploaded to Facebook. This really made her stand out. If anyone has any suggestions, please help!\"\n\nAny suggestions would be highly appreciated!\n\nThank you",

Why not create an ad-on that identifies this kind of spam and block it in advance.

If something as crazy as Welcome to Night Vale can become so popular, it means that Fantastic Four, in all its pulpy glory, is ripe for it.\n\nHire voice actors to play the main four, Doom, and any other villains you want to have them encounter. Give us \"Ultimate Nullifiers\" and \"Skrull Hypnosis\" instead of angsty twenty-somethings.\n\nAnd then, once it becomes a hit, work it into the MCU. Have the characters on Agents of SHIELD listening to the radio broadcast. Have Captain America and Winter Soldier listening to the broadcast as a way to cover up their own conversations. \n\nThis way, you can work the Four fighting against an ancient alchemist into the more serious MCU.\n\nAnd after a certain number of episodes, reveal that there's a Fan 4 tv series in the works, set to premiere specifically on ABC's website.\n\nRelease Fan 4 adventures as twenty minute webisodes, and start an ARG that ties it into the main MCU again, leading to, say Ant-man and Falcon finding the Baxter Building and recruiting the Four to come out of the shadows and help fight Thanos.\n\nObviously, this idea requires (A) Fox being willing to part ways with the Four and (B) a lot of planning in the radio serial and tv series front.\n\nBut the Four are an important part of Marvel lore, and this seems like the best way to get them into the public eye without us having to suffer Galactus Clouds and violent, writing changes that grind things to a halt.",

But that is also in the studio's favor. Piracy works because it's anonymous. As soon as a couple dozen copy right violations can be charged against the same person, the studios know who to focus their resources on. Or, the studio can pose as that torrenter, and release crap.

My camera follows the laws of physics.  I want an orthographic image.\n\n2.  I can't center my camera perfectly over my frame.\n\n\nSo here is my solution.  It's like a touch screen, but it is sensitive to infrared light instead of your fat greasy fingers.  \n\nNow my contraption would be about the size of a table, but far more useful than your average table.  It would have an incredibly high infrared sensor density, like 100,000 x 50,000 sensors, each one can detect the infrared light coming from the infrared flashlight array.\n\nSo you would set what you wanted to measure, whether it's your quadcopter frame, or your cell phone.  Now the giant infrared flashlight array (The same size as the table) that is directly above the table would activate.  The infrared sensors on the table would detect which sensors are receiving infrared light, and which ones are not.\n\nNow it would turn the results into an image, a 100,000x50,000 image where the lit sensors are white, and the ones who got no light are black.  Now you would have accurate measurements for your object, like, a resolution of 0.001mm.\n\nSo what do you think? Did I spend too much time typing this?",

            "selftext": "The idea I had yesterday came after reading another one of those \"magic mirror\" posts. The idea, of course, is beautiful- but I couldn't help but feel like more could be done. That's when it hit me! I remembered an engineer friend of mine who's getting paid for modifying his Amazon Echo and I thought \"THIS WOULD BE THE PERFECT APPLICATION!!!\"\n\nThe concept is to combine the conveniences of the Amazon Echo and the Raspberry Pi 2 to create one TRULY \"magic mirror\". Imagine a mirror in your bedroom that will not only show you your beautiful face, but also respond to voice commands to show you this morning's most popular posts from /r/upliftingnews, /r/news, /r/GetMotivated, etc. every morning when you wake up. You could also practice your dance moves in front of your mirror while changing songs AND getting complimented (or even adding disco effects to the screen but I'm definitely not smart enough to program that lol)!\n\nThis concept can get deeper and deeper with the options a Raspberry Pi 2 offers. You could keep a record of what you have in your fridge and run a script- based on voice command- to tell you the ingredients you have right now (maybe even storing the information via voice command). Combine this information with the internet and Pi programming, and you could ask your mirror to display what you can make for breakfast today!\n\nI made a post to the less popular /r/amazonecho and this was a response I got:\n\"Very very very do-able! There are a couple of ways to go about this. The most thorough way would be to write a skill, host it on said Raspberry Pi, and have it perform the actions there. My preference is Node.js with alexa-app-server. 'Alexa, tell magic mirror to show me motivation!' However, there is a way to do it WITHOUT writing a complete skill. This can be done using Amazon Echo HA Bridge to create the virtual device (motivation, time, twitter, etc), and then host a simple HTTP server on the Raspberry Pi that listens for the on/off commands. 'Alexa, turn motivation on'\"\n\nThoughts? I would do this myself, but I'm a very broke college student who can't afford the time or resources :/ If someone tries this out, please credit me for the idea!",

What if there was a site where they could look and see if a YouTube video or something could cause seizures? There would be some kind of reward system for contributors, such as ones who post a lot of seizure-free links, or give live help to people who want to watch a video or something but are afraid it might contain flashing lights // the person giving the help could tell them which part of the video to skip. Maybe the website could even have a built-in feature to easily cut out the seizure parts, replacing them with a black screen or a single frame that can explain what happens, if necessary. I know it'd be hard to moderate, but wouldn't this be awesome? I feel so bad for epileptics, I feel like the ones who have it worse can really live in fear.",

Its basically a harddrive attached to your router and a platform integrated within steam/windows/netflix. Noncritical downloads, that require much bandwith can so be postponed, they are marked as 'download this when there is bandwith leftover'. So you/your ISP defines times when excess bandwith is availible, and these downloads will be downloaded to your router; your PC/ terminal can be switched off. (This will be mostly during the early morning) When you start you PC/ end device the files will be transferred via LAN (which is much faster). The ISPs can use this to save bandwith during 'rush hours', and you have, mostly if you don't have very fast connection, the advantage of large downloads with an unaltered connection speed/ping of other applications.

            "selftext": "DUI causes about 11,000 deaths per year nowadays. That's actually a lot better than it used to be apparently, but how much better can we really get without something more than our current approach? I've always thought it's impossible to completely eliminate DUI purely through prohibition, education and cultural opprobrium since the same drug that impairs your driving ability also impairs your ability to make a good decision about whether you should be driving or not. If you could put interlocks in every single car it, though, it seems like you would practically eliminate it altogether. Sure, I'm sure there'd still be people skirting the system by getting a sober friend to blow, but having to have a complicit and sober partner in crime would make it far less common. Why would the sober person stick their neck out for a drunk friend like that? Why would the sober friend be sober if not to DD? I can think of reasons, but they'd be fairly rare.\n\nThe real problem is the cost. According to MADD, an ignition interlock costs about $70-150 to install and about $60-80 a month to maintain. The installation seems like a reasonable cost to add to new cars, but the maintenance does seem prohibitive. *But* if every car had them wouldn't the price probably come down a lot? Plus, I don't know this for sure, but I imagine a lot of that cost is due to liability risk for the company doing the maintaining since if the thing doesn't work right and the driver drives drunk and causes an accident the maintenance company could be in hot water. But perhaps that cost could be reduced by legislating certain immunities in court for maintaining companies? Just spitballing here. What do you guys think?\n\nSources for stats:\n\nhttp://www.madd.org/drunk-driving/ignition-interlocks/interlockfaq.html?referrer=https://www.google.com/#D\n\nhttp://www.cdc.gov/motorvehiclesafety/impaired_driving/impaired-drv_factsheet.html",

I'm guessing that some crap headphones and speakers might actually sound better with crystalization, and the sound card company made the choice to cater to the largest portion of their user base.  But it doesn't have to be this way.  Imagine a world where any headphones worth their salt included an RFID chip, or some other way to identify them to the device.  If this chip is present, by default, sound card drivers could quickly check the specs in some central database and apply whatever effects were needed to make them as close to reference as possible.  Many headphones would simply identify as \"reference\" so the sound cards would remove all effects (reducing latency as a bonus).\n\nI understand the need for junk like crystalization.

A bit would be a coin either the circumference of the current nickel or maybe somewhere between a nickel and a quarter.

Some gets a glimpse of the style you are wanting to capture and they can build an outfit for you. You then have the option to purchase these items directly from the website or app. The person then rates the styler and style. This will drive people to put thought into their style while keeping statistics on what you like and don't like style wise.\n\nI'm studying sport management wtf do I know about style. I just know I have none and am interested in getting some style and nothing like this exists to help me lol. \n\nI encourage people to rip this to pieces.

Commercials are over? the program is starting again, volume back to the previous volume. Simple an 'easy'.\n\n\nWhy am I sharing this idea: I have to many small projects already.\n\nTypical use: turn tv on, turn app on, leave phone on the coffee table. Let the app silence the TV when commercials start, and bring the volume back up when the program resumes.\n\n\nChallenges: get sound profiling and search algorithm. There are sample codes on the internet, Shazam has a very powerful and smart implementation but the algorithm is not fully proprietary. Get code to work with common TV box controllers -> Only part I don't know if is feasible. Create and maintain a sound profiling of up to date on air commercials. Playing special attention to the main broadcaster own commercials. The ones that go on air in every channel are easy to catch.\n\nDevelopment: Direct android, iox development. App starts, record 5 seconds every one minute or so (keep energy efficiency). Send sample sound profiling to data base/web service. Check database, return from web service: True (commercials on) or False (tv show on). If True, save current volume, decrease sound to low level, wait for False to put volume to user defined volume (the saved one). \n\nPut on app stores. Put adds that no one will see because people are watching TV. Or take the time when commercials are on to push something to user. Profit. Put my name on your acknowledgements, maybe some cash to my bank account, i don't know. You decide. Problem: idea is out there now. Hurry up!",

It would work with a set radius or diameter and only project sound that certain distance and not beyond that. \n\nI realize this is nearly impossible due to the characteristics of sound but I've heard of things like it. Maybe some kind of algorithm could be developed to determine the room size or something similar. \n\nThe use for this type of technology is so that if people are sleeping, or you have a tendancy to be loud at night and annoy neighbors, no sound can escape a certain area and you can listen to your entertainment in peace knowing only you can hear it, or a group of friends who are close enough. \n\n",

He intends to print by subscription, in ninety-six large volumes in folio, an exact description of _Terra Australis incognita_, collected with great care, and prints from 999 learned and pious authors of undoubted veracity.  The whole work, illustrated with maps and cuts agreeable to the subject, and done by the best masters, will cost but one guinea each volume to subscribers, one guinea to be paid in advance, and afterwards a guinea on receiving each volume, except the last.  This work will be of great use for all\nmen, and necessary for all families, because it contains exact accounts of all the provinces, colonies, and mansions of that spacious country, where, by a general doom, all transgressors of the law are to be transported; and every one having this work may choose out the fittest and best place for himself, there being enough for all, so as every one shall be fully satisfied.\n\nfull text : http://www.gutenberg.org/files/4737/4737-0.txt",

Wouldn't armor made of electro-magnetics be able to 'ping' back? So as the recoil is in progress, the entire upper half of the armor gets blown back by it, but due to the magnets it will not go far enough and will shift back, sort of in a way that metal fire shooting guy from Thor does when taking his head backward.\n\nProblably just a science-fiction idea, but what would prevent this?",

My idea is to let groups use the app to set up an account/group on the app for their cause, with it the leaders can set dates, put locations on a googlemaps style addon or something. People using the app can see icons on the map for different marches and are able to click on them for more information e.g time, what it's about.etc. People could subscribe to different groups or join them to be able to keep up to date on a \"newsfeed\" and get notifications. The organisers could use this to their advantage as lots of people now have mobile phones. I understand social media allows people to already do this, but if there were an app directly on people's phones with the information easily accessible with times, location, number of people going etc. It would greatly improve people's ability to take part and know about the political problems in their community.\n\nI have already posted this on /r/AppIdeas but wanted to share my idea further.

But then I get brought to the silly article.\n\nWhat I've done is, thanks to NoScript being in action and me needing to click on the video to enable it to load, is just mouse over the link and type in the URL that appears. Somehow, the last 5 videos I've done this for have had 2 or more l or I in them, which in my browser's font are indistinguishable, and so it takes me 3 to 8 tries just to get the video to load. So I've hated that.\n\nSurely someone can just make a script that skips all that hassle (and I recognize I could probably get the youtube url if I let the player load by right clicking on the video) and just brings me straight to the video on youtube's site. I'm not quite good enough in javascript to do that myself. Maybe over spring break I'll get around to it if someone doesn't take interest in it.\n\nThe only problem I can foresee is if there's multiple embedded videos. A good script might give a UI of sorts to choose which video(s) you want to watch before the redirect. A really good one would be able to create a playlist of these videos on your behalf if you wanted to watch multiple of them.\n\n(A bonus use is when the embedded video isn't allowed to be played outside of youtube because of copyright claims.)",

            "selftext": "This idea started when I was thinking hypothetically if every meme was $1 then all of the wealthiest people in the world would be hogging all of the memes to themselves instead of spreading them into circulation to help the \"memeconomy\" grow because people with only a few memes in their pockets would hold onto them tightly. Then the word *memeconomy* reminded me that there are people who say \"the market is flooded with rare pepes\" and there's also [this funny video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdhNkv4ryuM) so I thought to myself, how cool would it be to see a statistical representation of a meme in terms of how many different kinds exists and where is said meme being spread in the grand scheme of the internet? I know there are sites like **KnowYourMeme** for meme statistics through Google and **Neonmob** for collecting digital art but KYM doesn't get in-depth it seems and NM is mostly for original art not just copy and paste for the sake of sharing due to the potential to make money being involved. \n\nLike KYM, it'd be categorized and have a gallery associated with it but would have a lot more emphasis on the gallery as the point would be to upload (or link an image URL to to reduce server sizes) every single photo revolving around a meme or meme crossover to it's page to be able to generate a graph full of statistics. I'm not too knowledgeable on web analytics but I know there are sites to find every source of an image on the web and Google has a simple image search to find visually similar images. Based on those, this site could do something similar if not utilize them to find every instance of an image across the web given the timeframe that said meme first appeared. \n\nThe results would be a graph showing a variety of data for a certain meme and even specific varieties made for that meme to get a better feel for this *virtual economy of memes* we call the internet. I imagine a site like this would be something community run like Wikipedia so any volunteer admins could quickly and efficiently tend to the thousands of entries flooding in at start and forever after as new memes are created. \n\nIs this site idea realistic? If so I really hope somebody makes it. ",

I propose a microwave that does this for you. When its special \"popcorn\" button is pressed, the microwave activates an internal microphone that will pick up the sound of the popping. An electret mic should be adequate. A running average is kept of the time between successive pops once they get going, and the microwave automatically stops when the average falls to 2 seconds or so.\n\nBecause a \"pop\" is a pretty simple and impulsive sound to characterise, I suspect that no fancy DSP would be required, but rather a simple threshold trigger on a microcontroller would do the job. A manufacturer could likely just reprogram the controller they already use to incorporate the new feature, and since electret mics are cheap, the per-unit cost difference to the company could be made quite small compared to the HUGE SUMS people would fork over to have this amazing product!\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n^^ok ^^fine, ^^I'm ^^high, ^^fuckin ^^sue ^^me...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

'Maybe' these characteristics can be detected through certain frequencies of vibrations when going through mitosis.  Detecting this would be a challenge as you need a probe small enough to detect small vibrations, but if it is possible, I'm sure a computer could easily analyze the frequency given off by mitosis. This analysis 'could' be able to detect which is a cancer cell and which is a normal cell going through mitosis by the frequencies that are produced.  \n\nFurther, this technology to detect vibrations could be used in a sort of nano machine, about the size of a erythrocyte.  Data about what frequencies to detect (from analyzing cancer cells) are stored in the machine and when that frequency is detected, the machine executes cell lysis by releasing hydrogen peroxide, or some killer agent stored in the machine.\n\nThe machines themselves need to be able to either degrade, or be 'filtered out' as the they would not be able to pass through the kidneys.  Making a metal machine, a magnet might be able to fish them out of the blood, or CSF (for CNS cancers).  Further they need to be flexible in order to go through small spaces of the capillaries.  They 'could' be manufactured in the shape of a erythrocyte and be able to bend through these tight spaces.\n\nProbably impossible to implement, I don't know much, if anything, about electrical engineering or nanotechnology, but I feel detecting cancer cells through receptors or certain proteins might not be possible to kill ALL cancer cells in patients as cancer cell are constantly changing.  Therefore finding another way to detect each individual cancer cell 'might' be a better approach. ",

This would leave the most useful contributors appropriately compensated, while the students chasing deadends wouldn't have to find funds to see what's behind the catchy title. \n\nP.S.

            "selftext": "I am currently in an undergrad innovation class and we were tasked with designing something that could help conserve water. One idea that stuck was developing a modern day monitoring stick for residential and farming needs that can help reduce overwatering. \n\nThe jist is this: A metal rod that has on the bottom moisture sensors. On the top of the rod is a LED light that displays different colors based on the moisture readings. Inside the rod would be Wifi and GPS capabilities. We were thinking of making an app and website that can show you where all your registered rods were located per a real world map and information about each rod, like what the moisture readings and color of the LED light were. \n\nThrough the app one can also input what type of crops each stick is placed within. Since each plant requires different levels of water, we thought we could modify the light\u2019s changing of colors to be corresponding to each plant\u2019s needs with a database of this information.\n\nFor farms without farm-wide Wifi coverage (most likely the case), maybe shipping a version without the Wifi/GPS/app features for cheaper. \n\nI was curious what the logistics of an idea like this would be. Do you have any suggestions for the current idea?",

            "selftext": "looking for feedback and wondering if you'd read/watch this?\nWhilst sitting here high on painkillers (percolate)  and thinking of my recent associations with many different drugs the past year (Oxycodone, Methamphetamine, Adderall, Dxm, DMT, Heroin, Cocaine, Xanax,) Anything that got my dopamine telling me it was chill for a sec.  What I noticed was as long as I did sufficient research on the drugs, was prepared for comedowns when they came, and made sure I wasn't ever high or withdrawing at work (except for when I was) I could SUSTAIN my life while using these drugs. There is such a social stigma about drug use, that I truly believe we live in a Nation that does not believe moderation is possible - and thus when they \"go off the deep end\" all they are doing is recreating the conditioned behavior that drug use is going to either. \n\na. Kill Them \nb. Destroy their relationship with their family\nc. Land them in Jail or Prison\nd. Prevent them from being successful in anything, ever.\n\nLet's be like the Deadpool movie and back up a little bit. I am 21 years old, have maintained a good career in sales and bypassed college temporarily (Store Manager of a Cellular Store in a city of 25,000+) while getting high every single day on some sort of drug. I've found each has it's own positive way of being used and that if consumption of each one is minimal and you set limits and abide by them, drug use of all sorts IS sustainable if done right.\n\nTimes you Should not Use Drugs: For example. Don't do Methamphetamine right before giving a speech to a team of sales-people. Don't use Oxycodone before a work conference that is hard enough to stay awake in already. Don't do Heroin in the workweek unless you are faking being sick lmfao. Most importantly DON't USE DRUGS AS A CRUTCH. I think they are as addictive as anything we attach ourselves to during hard times, such as people, objects, or places)  \n\nTimes Drugs May Help You: Adderall to Clean at Work/Home/Be Creative, Xanax before a Match.com date that already has that awkward, 'even if this works out, we met on the fucking internet' undertone or before a job interview, Marijuana at the end of your day if you feel stressed out, Ambien after finding out that Freddy got killed so you can finally go to sleep without listening to bad jokes for 40 seconds then being killed though you were dead inside from his dry humor, Painkillers when you had to saw your own leg off because you were chained to a wall in a bathroom with your future boss basically giving you an interview you to be one of his employees right there in the room with you. \n\n\nBasically every type of drug and it got me thinking about the movie Super Size Me. I was a pretty good English student in High School, writing being my forte and could outwrite anyone in my graduating class with poise and half-stoned from some lunch hour toking. My other skill and hobby that I found was my Media class where I discovered a love and a talent for cinematography and directing. All semester we designed films to be placed in a local film festival to be judged. All semester I also thought it would be a good class period to do \"research\" on a film I didn't even know I was going to do yet, in other words I went outside to my car and took a couple rips then slept in the library. The night before it was due, I whipped up a commercial/PSA about child abuse and edited it the next morning before school started. I won the film-festival and it wasn't even close. I've always wanted to do something with this skill, but the dream of making something people would find interesting seemed more out of reach than a sexual encounter at a Big-Bang Theory party. \n\n\nTheory - We will never eliminate drug use in our country. What we can do is try to eliminate it's biggest threat - creating Drug users who KNOW THEIR LIMITS and sustain good jobs, take care of their kids, etc. and have sufficient treatment available when they need the help. if we taught and spent more empthasis on moderation instead of complete avoidance of drugs, we could create a nation aware of what drug use will do to you specific to each category of drug- and what negative side effects each of these will cause them in their lives including financial problems and health side effects such as overdose and fatal diseases. Even create a class on high school stimuli requiring students to try to budget around a drug habit with random jobs sorted so they could see the financial impact it would have on their life. I'm sure some drug users really never had it explained to them what these drugs will do to them, and like a young Forrest Gump taking an STD ridden prostitute back in Jenny, they are simply too naiive to seek this information themselves.  \n\nWhen I was in high school I recall the lesson on drugs to be essentially this- lazily show students outdated, misinformed, agenda-filled DVDs on different drugs and hope they never do them and if they do, well figure it out kid! As a result, many who become drug addicts are blindsided by the side effects because they have no education on what these drugs are doing to their brain and create self-fulfilling prophecies in their life, because the conditioned behavior we have received is that 'if you use drugs, the sky will fall you will steal from your family, rob banks, give yourself up for money and you will land in prison because we say they're illegal so just, like don't'  \n\nWell the problem with this like, condescending Ronald Reagan-era way of thinking that has obviously failed socially and economically. We have put power in the Cartel's and dangerous drug-dealers hands' that we could easily take out of theirs. If you could go to Enrique, the shady 43 year old guy with Cartel ties and get your coke, or some classy, helpful to the economy, cocaine gas station called Pump and Blow, what would you choose right? \n\n I would use statistics from Washington and Colorado about what legalizing marijuana has done for their states and apply them mathematically to the rest of the US to see what it would do for the economy. I would compare the US to other Nations that have drugs legalized and compare productivity. We would explore a world with a federally regulated country of Drug Addicts who are aware of their side effects and can get help, then for impact we would explore the Drug Wars' ugly father, the United States of America.  \n\nI probably haven't told you anything you don't already know. I'm just wondering if any of you had ideas or wanted to be a part of it. I'm located in Montana but am willing to travel for this project. Do you think this would be a better fictional, what-if book on a scenario we would explore the life of a once renowned cartel Kingpin, who now works odd jobs to support his family because the Cartel has no control anymore in N.A. Or a simple documentary exploring the pros and cons of a Continent/Country/World where drugs were controlled by the government. I am also wondering if this idea is interesting enough to warrant a documentary or a book (patent pending already) if you'd watch or read it? Thanks guys. Oh if you're reading this Chris Nolan, I think we could turn this into a trippy, thought provoking, scenario Truman Like show starring Leonardo Dicaprio who will win his second Oscar for this performance.\n\nCritique away: I love criticism, throw your ideas at me as well. I remember when books used to light matches and start revolutions. I would like this to be the match that lights the War on Drugs, even if it goes on for 100 years before people wake up. So I would like you, reddit, to be my red phosphorous and help me strike the match that will bring enslaving sick drug addicts that need help FOREVER, creating jobs and productive members of society economically who will take better care of their kids as a result. Let's go!\n",

            "selftext": "This is actually a combination of several ideas that are somewhat related:\n\nImagine if the next generation of the web (be they conventional, or blockchain-world-computer based) integrated commenting/contribution based on reputation? In a nutshell, everyone starts with the ability to post, say 300 words per day, and they use the same commenting account across all sites. If they want to be able to post more, they need to earn it by having their comments 'upvoted'. The more upvotes you get, the greater your reputation score, and in turn, the more you're permitted to contribute in future discussions, tweets, posts....\n\nThe point being that if you have nothing useful to contribute, then you're limited in how much you can disseminate your bullshit. In turn, we could expect to see a higher level of quality in content found online.\n\nThen of course, you might ask - what's to prevent rings of people ~~circle-jerking~~ upvoting each other's idiot ideas? You're not only limited in how many upvotes you can give out every day, but the **weight** of your upvote is directly proportional to your own reputation score.\n\nThis is not too far from how Google used to rely on PageRank scores, but unlike the PageRank system, a potentially sketchy user does not have unlimited ability to game the system and artificially boost their own reputation.\n\nA potential roadblock is how you would limit one universal account to each individual. This is an obvious challenge, because right now, it's not too difficult for one person to create multiple accounts on any given site or network. Account creation could be tied to a user's cell phone number (not perfect, but will reduce multiple-account creation substantially). A slightly better, though more expensive means would be to bring in real-world vetting by actual people equivalent to a notary public. ",

So this is how it goes, a city sends you info about an area or even the whole city that needs clean up, you allow only homeless men and women to go pick up whatever trash they get and go back to the center and get money by how much they get.\n\n1. How do you know if they just didn't get trash from a dumpster and say they got it from the whatever area needed cleaning?\n\n- Well you get someone to escort the homeless people to the area, it would be a lot more faster to do and could get to more areas to clean, also the person can look and verify that the trash is from the area that needed cleaning.\n\n2. How do you prevent crime from happening while cleaning is happening?\n\n- Now of course this cannot go for days as crime will happen, someone might feel jealous for other people because they might have more trash than others and they might want it by force. So i think this should be only for certain time or as long as all the trash has been picked up.\n\n3. If its going to be an area how can you ensure that every homeless person gets enough trash to at least get some money?\n\n- Now of course it cant be a small area, it has to be like the side of freeways, areas that really need help.\n\n4. How can every homeless person get enough money even if i am pretty sure everyone will want to go to these things?\n\n- there will be a certain amount of people that can go to these areas, if it gets full then the next area will be cleaned up by different people, now there will not be as much fighting to get in.\n\n5. How will you make money?\n\n- do some sort of tax so i can get something. But do i expect to be a millionaire? no, i prefer to help the cities and the Earth then to make a lot of money, i already have my university for that.",

            "selftext": "So I came up with an idea of a public workshop. Basically it's a building with various tools and machines inside for the public to access. \n\nNot everyone has the space or money for power hammers, various saws, plasma cutters, welders, etc etc. I've caught myself saying \"man I'd like to create this item but you need a lot of tools and machines to make it\". I'm not going to go out and purchase thousands of dollars worth of machines just to make one thing. So if there was a place I could go to use these things to create something it would be very helpful. You would obviously have to pay to go there but it would be a hell of a lot cheaper than buying crazy expensive machines. Anyone would be able to use it. If you are under 18 you would need an adult to accompany you. There would be waivers of course saying the owner isn't liable for personal injuries. And the employees could even train you how to use the tools and machines. They could also have items at the place for purchase like steel and wood. So that's basically my idea and id like to know what you guys think!",
