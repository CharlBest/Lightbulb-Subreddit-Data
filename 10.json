Basically, when a new born baby comes to life, they will extract and DNA sample from him and will be sent to the government. All The DNA information will be preserved in a secret databases by the government. The  purpose of this is that we can use this data to identify unknown criminals and all investigations. Lets suppose we have a sample in a crime scene whether its blood, spit , sperm cells for rapists, or a skin fragment or whatever, we can use to let the system to find a matched DNA in the database. When the match found then we basically got our culprit! This can be also to identify victims who's identity is unknown. The uses of such system are limitless and i know Its  against the right of privacy. I have done some research and I'm not sure if its possible to store all the genetic information for all people which makes the idea seems unrealistic. I don't deny there's so much issues with such as idea but I do believe this can change the world if been done. Hope to hear your opinion!",

            "selftext": "Hello Reddit. As everyone already knows, teenagers tend to do stupid things sometimes. Often, these can end up in them getting arrested and having a criminal record that carries over to adulthood. It's turns into a cycle, since it's hard for them to get a job. They end up committing more serious crimes, and everyone loses in the long run.\n\nI think that everyone should be given 1 \"burn card\" when they are born. The card would only be usable by that person. If they get arrested for a misdemeanor, such as disturbing the peace or petty theft, they can use the card to erase the record entirely, allowing for 1 free mistake. They would still need to spend the night in jail and show up in court, but would not face any other charges. The card would not be usable on felonies or other serious crimes.\n\nIf you still have your card when you turn 18, it can be exchanged for $2,000 cash (as an incentive for staying out of trouble), but can no longer be used in court to get out of jail free. The $2000 would still be cheaper than putting them through the system.\n\nI believe that this would greatly cut down on juvenile convictions, by giving everybody a little wiggle room, while rewarding people who stay out of crime.",

When people log on to this website or program, they are randomly matched with either an AI similar to cleverbot or another user, and neither user 1 nor user 2 knows which they got matched with. User 1 selects a pre-written question to ask the other user. If it is an AI, it gives its answer based on common responses for that question. If it is a human, then they  give whatever answer they want to. Then User 2 asks a question in a similar way (If it is an AI, it randomly picks a question) and user 1 answers. After they have answered a couple of questions, user 1 and user 2 (if human) determine if they have been matched with a human or an AI. If they guess correctly, they earn a point. If a user guesses incorrectly, then the other user earns a point. Afterwards if it was 2 humans matched together, they can chat freely.\n\n\"But what if a group tries to sabotage it with a specific phrase that the AI repeats?\"\n\nRemember that a human user has to put in a response first for the AI to use it. If you ask a question and get a stupid or random answer, you don't know if it's a bad or corrupted AI, someone trying to corrupt the AI, or someone trying to trick you into thinking it is the AI.",

Please give me some feedback!\n\n- Study from anywhere you want.\n- Study at anytime you want.\n- Study what you want.\n- Study how long you want.\n- Study with whoever you want.\n\nThe Government provides all material to learn anything you want online.\nThat can be done by abandoning schools while focussing on adding validated resources onto the Learning Platform. \nThe Website will have information about any topic you would like to study and provides tests, videos, documents and gives you ideas abou real life application that you can do right now.\n\nOnce you've studied enough you can take a test which validates your knowledge about that topic.\nFor that, your internet connection will be blocked by a governmental system that will be installed in your house so that you cannot cheat.\nAlternative:\nOnce you've studied enough you can apply to a test which you'll take in a \"Test Facility\" which will be the replacem Facility will be the validated knowledge checker which will then approve your studying.\n\nAfter that you can go to an \"Application Facility\".\nThere you will find professionals, other students that study the same thing and real life demostration of jobs where you're studies are being applied.\n\nExample:\n1. You're 10 Years old. You will get a free membership on the Governmental Learning Website.\n2. You browse through topics you're curious about and start learning.\n3. When you studied enough you take a test which validates your knowledge.\n4. You can apply to an Application Facility where you can talk to other students or professionals and get an inside view on the kinds of jobs that you can attend by having studied that topic.\n5. Once you got an overview about the different kinds of jobs available, you can decide which one you would like to attend or you can go on and study something different.\n6. You're applying to a job of your choice and you're getting notified when you can start your career.\n\n*Note that you will probably be taking multiple tests before applying for a job.\n\nHelpful TEDx Speeches\n- https://youtu.be/nMxqEkg3wQ0\n- https://youtu.be/sxyKNMrhEvY\n- https://youtu.be/0OkOQhXhsIE\nAnd there are many more...\n\nThis is also great: https://youtu.be/dqTTojTija8",

            "selftext": "Wouldn't it be a good idea for all high schools in America to become technical schools? And to offer a broad range of technical certificates and partnerships with technical colleges. \n\nI'm currently a senior at high school(dual enrolled also) and my school does have a certificate you can graduate with, but it's a CNA and that's not a job for everyone. We have electives that you can take to prepare you for certain jobs, but don't offer any other technical certificates and I think having them choose a pathway as a requirement would promote motivation in choosing one they like and learning it to their fullest extent.\n\nThe ideal high school in my mind would have each kid spending a semester in eight different subject (choose from healthcare, engineering, automotive, various office setting jobs(accounting, law, etc.), culinary, emergency services, teaching, sales/marketing, electrical/plumbing/HVAC, politics, etc). And the consecutive three years they could choose to still have a variety of classes but would be encouraged to stick with classes in one or two pathways. So some students can spend three full years on healthcare, while another could spend each year doing something different, while another might try to take on two at one time. \n\nThe high school in my mind would have the same requirements for graduation in a lot of places (at least 3-4 math, 3-4 science, 3-4 English, and history classes. And also 2-3 foreign languages. These could be spaced out over the students' four years.  The class schedule layout would have A & B days(or red and blue, 1 &2, whatever works) and would switch off each day, with one day(let's say A) would be focused on the academics (history, science, English, math, foreign language) while B days would be focused on whatever pathway the student chooses. Classes would be an hour a day, starting in the morning at 9 am and having four classes each day, with fifteen minutes between each class, as well as a 45 minute lunch and a 45 minute study hall. The later than usual starting time is because I have experienced waking up at 6-7 am for school and also getting to sleep a later before class, and it not only improved my mood and attitude all day it also improved my learning experience. Class would end at 3:30. \n\nDuring the senior year the students would spend a lot of time either shadowing, interning, or doing clinicals or hands on practice in the real world(either through a school program or on your own time). The school could also partner with local technical colleges that could help get students even higher level certificates after they graduate.\n\nThe school would have sports teams and extracurriculars just like other high schools, but it would really prepare teens for adulthood and provide them an advantage in the job market with their certificate and experience. How does this sound? I just see it as a way to change the view on the youth of today. Right now, high school graduates are expected to get a job at fast food or something very paying minimum wage, when we could set them up for success, by teaching them skills they WILL use. \n",

            "selftext": "There's a lot of young people in my area who are affected by bullying, as was my sister and it deverstated her mental health. She spent years socially isolated and for months would be in a psychiatric hospital after having failed suicide attempts. The think that changed her life was meeting a group of people through a group that was full of people with similar backgrounds, she said to me that the thing that made it work was that they all wanted to connect with other people who would be mindful, respectful and open to making friends. She's now in employment, going to college, has a huge circle of friends and hasn't been in hospital for over 2 years. It's really got me thinking about early intervention and how children could be helped while they are still at school.\n\nMy idea is to organise local clubs for young people who are socially excluded, for whatever reason although I expect most will attend due to bullying as it is a significant problem in my community. Weekly we would organise fun activities decided by group members to have fun, build confidence and communication and have a drop in for young people to talk to a volunteer if they felt like it. You see, my sister told me that even when the bullying stopped people still didn't want to be her friend so she had nothing to do (apart from hang with me) after school. She said if she had friends outside of school it wouldn't have been so bad because she would have been able to believe that people could like her that weren't just family.\n\nI know I could run it because I have experience working with young people and of organising community groups. My current role is in fundraising and I'm responsible for generating income way above what would be needed to run this (I've made a business plan and have done my financial budgets for war 1 - 3).\n\nMy worry is... am I missing something? Why is no one else doing this already? Am I wrong thinking that this would help, I know schools do all that they can but I think that young people deserve more while they are being bullied and after. Just because bullying stops doesn't mean young people stop being socially isolated. If we intervene early and help them build social connection and skills I believe it will change and improve their lives now and in the future.\n\nI so hope this will work. What do you guys think?",

Echo and other devices would be set up to ignore commands coming from the same source as that watermark (since, at least with Echo, it can detect what direction the sound is coming from).",

The main defects of this tradition as I see it are: it's sexist, it's unfair that only the groom has to do it, and it's essentially an empty gesture held over from a time when men owned their daughters. But if you were raised traditionally, it may feel weird to pass the tradition by. \n\nSo my idea is, we start a new tradition where, as soon as possible after the proposal, the bride and groom both invite their parents over for dinner. They announce to everyone at once that they are engaged. They each formally thank their own families for raising them and each other's families for raising the person they want to spend the rest of their lives with. Everybody toasts the shared future of their soon to be joined families. Both families are included and no one has to feel sexist or objectified. Also if the parents haven't met each other yet it's a good opportunity to for them to get acquainted.",

Pretty straight forward.\n\nThe key that makes it different from people reacting (like, dislike) to posts on Facebook is it aggregates the reactions to form a public opinion on specific subjects.\n\nTo do this the posts would implement a clever tagging system to isolate specific subjects within the post to evaluate independently. For example, in the post:\n\n> CNN blasts Trump for comparing our security officials to Nazi Germany.\n\nThe tags would be \"CNN\", \"Trump\", and even \"Nazi Germany\" if he user felt like it. Those individual subjects could be reacted to in the context of the post, so one could react positively to CNN standing up to Trump as well as negatively to Trump for his words. This removes the common issue of having to one give one opinion on an entire multifaceted statement.\n\nThis data can then be extrapolated into graphs to give real time statuses of the public opionion, like the opinion on \"Volkswagen\" has dropped 15% in the last week due to the indictment of their engineer. While also providing data per post to see the public opinion on individual statuses.",

            "selftext": "\nTwitter is being used more and more like a petition, and Facebook is being forced to rate articles, in addition to considerable pressure to add a dislike button. These are big reluctant players in the new political landscape.\n\nAt the same time there are hundreds of new initiatives trying to push their way into the market, here is a list of some of them,\nhttp://democracy.foundation/similar-projects/\n\nNow consider this, If you ruled the world and decided one day, because you are a nice guy, that you wish to know the desires of your people, and you really meant it, would you?\n\nA). Have people design all different kinds of Organizations that work in different ways, with different questions to answer, and then take all that and try to figure out what the people want.\n\n                   OR\n\nB). Get the best people together you can to build one system using the best agreed-upon technology,(Google search engines).\n\nThe founding fathers of the United States did not decide to \"farm out\" the voting process to a variety different organizations for this obvious reason.\n\nAll those other direct democracy initiatives require you to traverse menus, and answer questions. The limited amount of data they are working with and their use of questions, makes it unfeasible for them to use search engines.\n\nRemoving questions enables google style search engines, which then enables unlimited data, which then allows for a monopoly on the opinion market, owned by the \"people\".\n\nThe ease of expressing your opinions on anything, all in one location, with no menus, will have a compounding effect on participation.\n\nBut there is something even more important we would like to show you, in the natural process, when a small group of people are trying to find consensus, suggestions and ideas are put forward by any one or more individuals in the group. \n\nInformal voting takes place. \n\nBased on that information, more suggestions may emerge.\n\nThis process is repeated until the highest level of satisfaction is achieved.\n\nOnly then is the vote official. The free flow of unofficial voting is essential.\n\nWe would like to add that various voting reforms are attempts to supplement for our inability to provide, the free flow of unofficial voting. we are recreating this on a worldwide scale.\n\nThe \"Your Upinion\" App, all opinions, on all subjects, no questions.\n Here is our plan, http://www.yourupinion.com/\n\nWe are asking if you could take a moment to give us your perspective, and let us know if you would like to be involved.\n\nWe would also like to ask that you refrain from commenting if your comments are in regard to one of these three areas:\n\n1) If you do not believe that the people of the world are capable of governing themselves, then you are not going to add anything constructive to this discussion.\n\n2) Fraud, security, and other technical issues will not be dealt with at this point because of the expertise that will be required that this organization does not yet possess. But let it be noted that no company will ever be able to claim 100% security.\n\n3) this plan requires that we gather approximately 1/2 million participants worldwide in order to make it feasible to start. This is because we need to justify the high cost of a good quality search engine, and people are needed to raise the content to an acceptable level so it will be interesting.\n\nSo therefore any argument that this plan is too far-fetched may be correct, but is not helpful.\n\nThank you from our 71 members, and myself, Brian Charlebois.\nPs, I'm always available for phone calls 1 780-224-2623\n\n",

Red and Green compete for the Yellow space, while Yellow and Blue compete for the overall subjective spectrum.  What if your personal spectrum were 'unfolded', your color-space blind-spots rendered visible?\n\nNow I'm going to paste some sloppily edited notes from somewhere else...\n\n-)---\n\nspectrum: unfold it.  Comparison with typical false-color schemas:  Pack AMAP [as much as possible] spectrum into the present \u201cfolded\u201d complex opponency.\n\nHue map transform -> make R/G and Y/B combinations we cannot innately differentiate into ones we can.  One potential application is to re-render real-time perception [RGB-in at camera to RGB-out at display] to maximize tetrachromat-to-tri/bi/monochromat utility equivalency.  [The user will be able to apply information that was previously inaccessible to them to making decisions, taking-actions/selecting-beliefs.]\n\nAnd yes, you could do this in AR, as a smartphone app, etc.  [Obviously, to minimize meaningful loss of similar-HSL values, you have to optimize the transform across all three (HSL), btw.]\n\nOne could apply a parameter-tweaked version of this transform to pack in IR, UV, etc., though the HSL-delta losses will outweigh the gains for some applications.  It\u2019s not difficult or far-fetched to imagine people becoming dependent on this utility...\n\nThe algorithm pretty much writes itself:  (1) How many points (and in what dimensional distribution) in the, say, sRGB color-space {x}?  (2) How many points are we (the visual-normative population/ \u201ccolorblind\u201d/ soldier/ environmental scientist) insensitive to in the opponency-enforced (read your neurobiology, folks) R/G and Y/B subspaces, for example {Y}..{?} (as encompassed by the reference/device-space) and what shape would those take if our perceptual color-space were uniform, rather than folded?  (3) Take the alternate-space map and insert the normally imperceptible sub-spaces.  (4) This obviously will deform the (bio-reference) percept-space in a manner that is probably suboptimal for many applications;  Renormalize the new map back down to the target user\u2019s percept-space.  [To 100 original distinguishable points in a hypothetical linear spectrum, we inserted 10 here and 5 there.  We take the new, \u2018distorted\u2019 115-point space and divide it by 100 for our new spectrum.  Sort-of, more-or-less\u2026  Shut up, I\u2019m bad at math.]\n\n-)---\n\nI can poop out improvised algorithm sketches all day long, but I lack the resources at this time to implement this one.  Have fun, y'all.  (And yes, some credit for the idea would be spiffy, thanks.)\n",

We rarely have time to sit down and think about what you actually want to learn, you're distracted by the \"what you're required to learn\" and often just assume that's what's best for you because that's how it is. \n\nThis course should be there to develop a love for learning, critical thinking about the world around them, and intellectual debate and discussions between students. You could either learn or teach someone something you know or search for it online, and the teacher can teach you how to find credible sources for your interest. I think that's how school should be and how students should be.

You might discover effective builds of top players becoming closely guarded secrets to prevent this - which would add an element of mystery and intrigue to the metagame.\n\nYou'd see people trying wackadoo silly builds to try and game that advantage - but if they did too good a job of balancing between uselessness and nerfiness, they could expect others to do the same. \n\nAnd holy shit, *nobody* is doing Holy Destroyer builds any more.... we could mop up! (for about a day)\n\nThe epidemiology of anti-fashions within a small, competitive space could be a very interesting thing to watch indeed.  Maybe with a little hysteresis to make equilibrium hard to achieve... \n\nhmmmm\n\n",

It would require proof of the debt as well as proof of inability to pay. The charity would then distribute donations equally amongst those in need. \n\nThe website could list those in need, anonymized to first name, as well as their debt amount and potentially a small blurb about their story to draw empathy and increase donations. From this portal users could donate to the charity to be distributed evenly or donate to individuals themselves.\n\nCurrently people use websites like GoFundMe to try to get donations for causes like this, but unless your story goes viral you're likely to only get donations from friends and family, and many are too proud to ask for money from those close to them. This charity offers a centralized cause that anyone including corporations can make donations to. Other charities help with similar causes like the American Red Cross but they often only cover utilities and rent for people that can't afford it because of medical bills, which to me is adressing the result not the cause.",

            "selftext": "There's been a lot of discussion about self-driving cars choosing between the life of its passenger and the life of another in potential collisions. See here: http://moralmachine.mit.edu/\n\nBut the scenarios assume a driverless car has all the same abilities as a human driven car.\n\nSans driver a car could:\n\nAdd a bunch of safety features that would be ineffective due to human [risk compensation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_compensation).\n\nRemove the steering wheel and instrument panel so there's less solid objects for passengers to hit.\n\nPut crumple zones in a human driver's line of sight as they no longer need to see. There'd be no need for a big windshield that things can crash into or out of. No driver means none of the windows are needed to let the driver see where they're going. Replace them with crumple zones. You could even convince passengers to wear full helmets by putting VR in them that shows the outside view.\n\nGive much finer wheel control so the car can orientate the whole vehicle, such the crumple zones while be optimally aligned for a coming collision.\n\nGive the car the ability to rotate seats into the optimally safe orientation.\n\nMuch smarter airbags that can be informed of incoming collisions so that they have much more time to inflate. This would make them less dangerous in themselves and give them more time to achieve complex tasks like specifically protecting vulnerable body parts, and shift the inflation zone in the direction of the collision.\n\nWith the external visual feedback, external airbags could even be aimed at pedestrians for optimal pedestrian protection.\n\nPhysically separate passenger and engine cabins, so the car can eject the passenger cabin in a safe direction and so the brakes are more effective on the less heavy passenger cabin and so if the vehicle hits a pedestrian the option exists for them to only take the hit from just the lighter passenger cabin.\n\nElevator suspension so that the vehicle can reduce ground pressure of a wheel that is about to run over something so it does less damage, or it could lift itself or even jump over obstacles.\n\nDrone tech on the engine cabin can avoid an obstacle by flying over it. Also this way while your passenger cabin is parked, your engine cabin can fly off and provide an uber service towing other passenger cabins. Having engine cabins travel by air when alone reduces the potential for collisions and frees up road space.\n\nMachine arms that can be used as high tech cow catchers that can make things safer for the vehicle and the cow(or whatever being collided with), combines well with external airbags. Bonus usage, easy automatic trailer/passenger-cabin hitching and cargo loading. Simplifies parallel parking by providing a forklift style solution.\n\nEquip the machine arms with various safety devices like deflection panel, net guns, water jets, etc. so they can better handle incoming collisions. \n\nAdvanced laser headlights that can shine specific warnings at other people on or about the road.\n\nPolice protocols could exist that remotely take control of driverless engine cabins, such that every engine on the roads is a police vehicle. Machine arms could even physically restrict tailgaters and other dangerous drivers. And with separate engine cabins they could do this while causing no risk to the passengers in the passenger cabin.\n\nMaybe there's even safety features unimaginable in our human driven world like the proper use of turn indicators.\n\nWhatever the case cars might become so packed with safety features that the trolley problem might end up being as irrelevant to self-driving cars as it is to the autopilot in planes.",

Perhaps having it next to refrigerator or something so it can't be scanned from outside. They just use their phones NFC reader to get the info and be online. \n\nThis way you can change the password whenever, but your friends who come over often can still use your wifi without you having to tell them the strange sequence. This is especially handy if you can't remember your password when asked. \n\nAn expanded module could also provide time limited passwords, so that people can have a password when they come over but you don't have to give them the permanent passcode. Handy for parties with lots of strangers that don't come over very often. ",

In addition to various changes in pages relating to policy, it appears that the Spanish translation has disappeared. https://www.whitehouse.gov/espanol states that \"You are not authorized to visit this page\". \n\nI believe that access to this information is more important than one's politics. I would like to organize a translation effort of everything on the site- primarily to Spanish, as I know the language and it is the second most common language in the US, but to other languages as well, if others could help. \n\nIs this an idea that makes sense?

            "selftext": "Below is an economic proof to describe how President Trump can negotiate a deal with Mexico to convince them to pay for boarder wall. The basis of this proof is that the ability of the United States\u2019 intelligence gathering and military community is by design extremely effective at identifying and eliminating any threat. The idea here (or \u2018art of the deal\u2019 if you will) is that America\u2019s ability to wipe the cartels off the face of the earth is much more effective in terms of cost and schedule. The only problem is that if this strategy is used and the United States is able to remove the drug cartel problem from Mexico there will be no need to build a boarder wall because the people of Mexico will have significantly less reason to want to flee North of the border illegally. \n\nCost to build Trump boarder wall: U.S. $25B total via IBTimes (Link #1)\n\nCost to fight ISIS: U.S. $11MM per day x 365 days = U.S. $4B per annum via Business Insider (Link #2)\n\nCost to Mexico to Fight Drug Cartels: $172.7B per annum via Forbes (Link #3)\n\nTotal Global Economic Impact of Violence: $9.8 trillion or 11.3% of the global GDP. (Link #3)\n\nAssumptions:\n\nEfficiency of U.S. war on ISIS is currently only 50% and therefore the actual cost to completely eliminate is twice as much per annum (Note: I have completely made this up)\n\nCost to arrest and imprison all drug cartel personal (or kill if only absolutely necessary) is also exactly twice the cost per annum as the current fight against ISIS (again, completely made up)\n\nTotal Expected Duration of Threat Elimination 3 years (probably would be less) \n\nTotal Expected Duration of Mexico to eliminate threat is also 3 years (it\u2019s not \u2013 it\u2019s currently infinity)\n\nCalculation:\n\nTotal Expected Cost for U.S. to Eliminate Threat: (U.S. $4B per annum) x (2 efficiency increase) x (3 years)  = U.S. $24B Total\n\nTotal Expected Cost for Mexico to Eliminate Threat: (U.S. $172.7B per annum) x (3 years)  = U.S. $518.1B Total\n\nTotal Direct Savings to Mexico for American Intervention: U.S. $494.1B \n\nTotal Expected Savings to Mexico over 10 Years: U.S. $1.7 Trillion Dollars\n\nTotal Global Economic Savings Impact Over 10 Years: U.S. $98 Trillion Dollars\n\nRight or wrong I would like to emphasis the importance of absolute non-violence whenever possible. It would be much more cost effective to use espionage to track and detain cartel operatives. Rather than implement U.S. Foreign Policy 101 (see #4) which has been proven overwhelmingly ineffective in Vietnam, Laos, Iraq, Afghanistan, etc. etc. etc. which has been proven in endless congressional hearings and other means that bombing entire villages in the Middle East only creates more sentiment for radical Islamic groups let's instead opt for the most non-violent method possible to eliminate the threat. \n\nOr\u2026. We could end the war on drugs in the U.S. and therefore treat drug abuse RETROACTIVELY rather than PROACTIVELY and create therefore make illegal drug trafficking economically fallible. Therefore yielding the same economic savings listed above as well as U.S. $41.3B per annum in savings from the elimination of enforcement and an annual tax revenue of U.S. $46.7B (#5)\n\nCan somebody prove me wrong?\n\n#1  http://www.ibtimes.com/donald-trump-border-wall-who-will-pay-it-what-will-it-look-how-much-will-it-cost-2443883\n#2  http://www.businessinsider.com/how-much-does-isis-war-cost-2016-1\n#3 http://www.forbes.com/sites/doliaestevez/2014/06/19/mexicos-astonishing-spending-on-fighting-drug-cartels-has-not-reduced-violence/#4d41d842c8d7\n#4 http://weknowmemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/were-gonna-free-the-shit-out-of-you.jpg\n#5 https://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/DrugProhibitionWP.pdf\n\n\n",

            "selftext": "The idea is simple in theory, but nearly impossible in practice and I want to work out details that will make it more practical. Block-Chain currency does marvelous work in cross-checking purchases. I'd like to crowd source journalistic credibility through the use of Block-Chain credits. I'll dub this fictional coinage Heed for now.\n\nSpecifically, anyone who is Heed-worthy:\n\n1. Cites their sources.\n2. Maintains a professional distance with their subject matter.\n3. Is at the mercy of peer verification.\n4. Provides entertainment and education as a service.\n\nThis crypto-currency is earned by peer review in the public sphere, such that folks who back up sketchy publishers risk tarnishing their own reputations (folks can see which Heed backs which, just as folks may see purchases made but not necessarily by whom). Folks who invest their trust in reputable sources accrue value over time, so that their Heed rank goes higher the more valuable, well researched work they produce/support in relation to the rest of the Heed using base. The goal here being that good writers/pundits are rewarded by their peers, while bad writers/pundits or those who use mass to bolster their work tabloid style are not.\n\nThe trouble I keep running into with this idea is very similar to the issues Wikipedia faces: Verification. There are no new ideas under the sun, and I'm aware of ethics boards and subscriptions out there that perform this service, but outside of voting, likes, and whatever social media shorthand is out there, I haven't seen any sort of cross platform \"social currency\" out there, and certainly not one that utilizes the strengths of Block Chain.\n\nThoughts? Too much to hope for? Too subjective a source for Block-Chain's objective interactions magic? This is all very rough in my mind, but with the devaluation of media due to its ease of access (regardless of the current political climate, information both true and false has never been \"cheaper\" or easier to access), I want to find a way to bring value to what people have to say, and provide crowd-sourced incentives as a means of fulfilling the roles publishers, and editors have filled in ages past.",

Accelerometers in the bands will move the keys around under your fingers as you move your hands around to simulate real keyboard use. When you put a finger down the beam is interrupted and the key is pressed.\n\nSnap your dominant hand to the right and the wristband will swap to mouse-mode, now moving your hand around moves the mouse around the screen and putting your fingers down activate left and right mouse. The non dominant hand remains in keyboard mode, so for example you could play a game moving with WASD left hand and shooting with right hand mouse.\n\nVarious configurations could be set up to lock to certain keys like left hand only display WASD, or numberic only keyboard on a second snap to the right, or pinch to zoom using both hands, etc.",

Often when listening to music around others, people usually have only one ear in so that they can hear if anyone says anything. \n\nEarbuds/headphones usually have mics. The app/tool would can overlay things your friends say on top of your music. A group of people can be linked together manually, by WiFi network or location. That way you get the stereo audio and can also easily communicate with those around you if you need to instead of only having one ear in or having to get someones attention.\n\nThe next bit is a bit more into futurism:\nHaving the device recognize those nearby who you want to hear and cancelling all other noise out. In crowded/loud places, instead of playing reverse sound to cancel white noise, it can completely seal off sound and only play what you want/need to hear. \n\nAny thoughts?",

Incentivising the wealthier can be achieved in the form of increasing the base tax for those in the upper tax brackets, but providing tax benefits for larger families (equivalent to taxing for financial disparity), whereas disincentivising having too many children for those financially struggling can be achieved by issuing stepped birth taxes.. An optimal equilibrium point should be reached where the cost of birth cancels out with the tax benefit at two children for the middle class. ",

That means there's a 1/24 chance that any two vehicles share that same plate style (assuming an equal distribution).\n\nThat way, you don't need to remember a random sting of numbers. You can just remember \"Oh, it was a white car with a yellow triangle plate\", and it would make it much easier for officers to locate the vehicle.\n\nAlso, this could be a moneymaker for the DMV.

            "selftext": "Essentially, you're providing an outlet or sink to remove CO2 from the closed loop.\n\nIdeally, you want a non-carbon producing source of energy, e.g. a nuclear reactor. In this idea, the reactor would provide power to vacuum pumps to pull air through a series of beds, but other options for separating carbon dioxide exist. There would need to exist several types of adsorbent materials to scrub the air into separate consituents, e.g. a dessicant to adsorb water vapor. The last bed would adsorb carbon dioxide. \n\nThis carbon dioxide rich bed of zeolites would then be packed and \"delivered\" into a volcano or into magma underneath the earths crust. The exact method for how this would be done needs to be flushed out. The idea here is to submit the carbon dioxide to extremely high temperatures to break the bonds, likely converting it into carbon and oxygen whilst burning the clay material of the zeolites into its individual atoms. Carbon dioxide can't burn, but at extremely high temperatures, the bonds should be broken and occurring within the magma itself, will convert it into other materials. By inserting the carbon dioxide into the volcano (deep within the lava itself), you require less energy overall than by providing the heat energy externally, likely producing more CO2 in the process. \n\nI'm assuming this would all be sunk cost unless governments around the world pay for this service, i.e. a waste removal service, the waste being CO2. \n\nThere are a variety of technical hurdles. The first one that comes to mind is how to actually insert the carbon rich zeolites into magma; the goal is to insert the carbon rich zeolites deep enough for long enough time to convert it and break it down as opposed to re-releasing it back into the atmosphere. The second hurdle will be obviously designing the process to preferentially adsorb the zeolites without using an excessive amount of energy or materials; again, however, if a nuclear reactor provides the energy source, that should at least eliminate some of the carbon load. \n\nAgain, the idea here is to scrub the CO2 and remove it from the loop. My original thought was to send the CO2, as a gas, into outer-space, like a tap on the earth. So long as the CO2 is pumped far enough away, it might be possible to accelerate it past earth's gravitational pull and float the CO2 to wherever, possibly towards the sun, if that's possible. There are balloons that can reach almost outer space, and if it can hold a very light material to pump the CO2 through, then it should be feasible to expel the CO2 into outer space. With this thought in mind, I then thought that if CO2 can be inserted into magma and broken down, that might makes things easier to basically take CO2 out of the loop.",

            "selftext": "So pretty much what the title says.  Alot of people don't feel comfortable donating to homeless foundations etc. because they are never sure if all their donations actually get to where it needs to go... My idea is to start an online registry for the homeless to sign up for in order to accept gifts and donations directly.  This service could be offered by a public library, shelter, church, or any other businesses who would volunteer to help. Of course they would need to have a computer and access to the internet... The said homeless person would set up a public profile with a little personal information, maybe a picture, and list their shoe size, clothing size, and maybe list some basic needs like soap, toothpaste, or whatever they may need at the time. Anyone would then be able to log on, browse profiles, and donate to whoever they may feel like. They could also search by keywords to be able to donate specific items.  The people donating would also have the option to do it anonymously. I also thought of setting up a paypal account for each of the homeless people to accept money as a donation, but not sure if that is possible because it may require a checking account. Most importantly we would need an honest location with a mailing address that would receive the donations to distribute to the homeless. I feel a shelter or church would be willing to participate. ",

Eternal fundraising would dry up in no time (especially when the results are so fragile), and people would get beyond desensitised by constant nagging.\n\nIt would be... somewhat less stable... granted, but weighed against the current difficulty of shifting incumbents, it might just pay off.

            "selftext": "\"The Hunted\" is an entertaining and interesting new show on CBS (I'm not going to discuss it's more ridiculous elements here, I just want everyone to be familiar with the basic concept). In this show, 9 teams of 2 are given a sum of money ($5,000 iirc) and tasked with evading capture from ex-law enforcement/FBI personnel for a month (one stipulation being that they remain within a specified area spanning all of South Carolina, Georgia, and parts of neighboring states), if they succeed, they are rewarded with a cash prize. The idea of the show is to present various team's strategies for going \"on the run\" (indirectly inviting the viewer to think about \"how would I do it?\") and make a display of just how skilled and effective the FBI are at tracking and apprehending fugitives.\n\nMy idea is to take this TV show concept, and pivot it towards something that is very much in the public discussion at the moment: **Illegal Immigration**.\n\nThere seems to be a popular notion these days that simply wandering across the border is an easy thing to do that happens all the time. But is it?\n\nMake a Reality-Gameshow that tasks it's contestants with crossing an international border undetected and let's find out. Since this show has no requirement that contestants evade capture/detection for any extended length of time, instead of taking 9 teams and following then week after week (until each one is captured or succeeds), since this show has could feature 2 or 3 new teams' attempts, start to finish, each week.\n\nOf course, there would need to be *a lot* of safety issues taken into account. We don't want contestants getting lost and dehydrating in the desert. We don't want any overzealous \"volunteer border patrolmen\" shooting a contestant. We also don't want anybody actually getting arrested.\n\nWith those things in mind, would this show even be remotely feasible (plus, how undetected is \"undetected\" when you're traveling with a film crew?) Maybe not. But if it could, I think this would be an effective means of communicating the reality of border security with the public in an entertaining way that they'll actually watch and be entertained by.\n\nIf border security really is riddled with holes, this show would serve as an advertisement for why it needs to be strengthened. If border security is actually quite good at doing their jobs, this show would illustrate the point that maybe we need to be focusing on more pressing/*actual* problems.",

This is why I think that every policy plank in the platforms of the political parties (here in the US) should include a set of links that describe how their policies would work and what data supports these conclusions. \n\nAlthough new research is constantly changing how we view the old research, it should be possible to create knowledge links to support the claims of the efficacy of the particular policies that are being promoted. For instance, we can connect [nutrition to impulse control](http://scopeblog.stanford.edu/2012/10/18/how-nutritional-choices-may-affect-impulse-control-and-brain-efficiency/) which can lead to [kids staying in school](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0743558403258860) which can lead to [lowered rate of criminal behavior](http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/aea/aer/2004/00000094/00000001/art00009) which can lead to lower crime in our communities.   \n\nI think that this type of political decision making would help our country move away from the constant bickering, although there may still be a problem with \"alternative facts\" being used.

            "selftext": "In the 1970s there was a school in England named Summerhill where students did no formal studying; they just did their own thing like reading, playing, talking, etc and for graduation they're required to write and defend an essay (in front of a panel of adults) on how they're going to be a productive person when they leave Summerhill.\n\n\nThat's a bit too extreme for me and many others, but I propose something similar to the Summerhill model but with a new requirement: a school where students don't engage in formal academic study, but instead prepare for and enter competitions all year long in order to graduate and earn a qualification.\n\n\nCompetitions can include the usual school fare like forensics, cheerleading, sports, writing, math Olympiad etc. and also include the ones more open to the general public like film festivals, singing competitions, novel writing, amateur sports, etc. If we want to stretch the scope of \"competition\" we can even include art exhibitions, presenting papers at a conference, stage theater, marathon runs, building a computer etc.\n\n\nEach student should commit to preparing for and entering a specific number of competitions, chosen from a list compiled by the school admin from information submitted by organizations, businesses, city council, federal govt, etc. They would not be required to win (although that would be a bonus and a huge boost) but they must document every single step of the way, pre-, while- and post-competition. Obviously competitions will overlap in time, and some takes longer to prepare than others, so students would have to submit their personal training/preparation schedule to be approved by the school before they're allowed to start anything.\n\n\nThe teachers would not be teaching in the traditional sense but instead become more like an enabler: finding a music studio, sourcing scientific equipment, hooking up with experts, drive students around, help them plan their prep. But the bulk of preparation should be done by the students themselves.\n\n\nIn order to graduate, students would be required to present the documentation of the competitions they've entered, plus another presentation on the hard skills (academic or technical know-how) and soft skills they have learned after entering these competitions.",

            "selftext": "One of the biggest growing concerns on the internet is the amount of falsified information parading around as fact. Some is out right dangerous, misleading people in ways which could cause lives to be ruined. Others are, on the face of it, more benign and could be passed off as a simple joke. That is of course until you take into consideration the big picture and realise that the vast swarms of small-time propaganda and fallacies have made it almost impossible for the average internet user to determine what is and isn't accurate, resulting in people either accepting most of what they read, or becoming over spectacle of everything they come across. The latter of the two options is certainly the better, where it forces the individual to take it upon themselves to find out the truth about what they have seen, but when the frequency of these instances is as vast as it now can be, most people just don't have time.\n\nSo that's where this idea comes in.\nIt would be a browser plug-in which would be able to identify articles displayed on screen. When a new article is loaded that the browser has globally not come across before it assigns it a unique identifier, whether it's a post shared around facebook, or an article on BBC news, that specific article would then be identifiable by the browser on everyone's device around the world.\n\nWith the plug-in installed, an article would have an extra panel loaded with it (the location relative to the article could be set as a preference by the user). The panel would offer the following options and features:\n\n* Overall votes for either 'True', 'False', of 'Incomplete Facts'\n* The ability to vote themselves\n* The ability to Link to sources and references which help prove the articals validity one way or another\n* The ability to comment your own opinion on the article\n* The ability to vote on the accuracy of others comments\n\n\nUltimately, what this will do once enough users are involved is mean that when an article comes up on your screen, not only can you quickly see if it is true or not with a fair level of accuracy, there should be a number of sources (which is a major thing lacking in most online journalism) to allow the reader to easily come to a conclusion themselves without having to spend time trawling the internet themselves for evidence.",

            "selftext": "So with all this talk about \"fake news\" running around from both sides of the political spectrum, I began to think about the possibility of a truly objective news agency. Is it even possible?\n\nI came to the conclusion of \"no\", but I also thought of how we can get to \"as good as it gets\". I'm going to call it The AGAIG Post.\n\n---------------------\nPolicies of The AGAIG Post, an internet news agency:\n\n**1) Empiricism is valued above view count.**\n\nThis policy is here to enable all of the following policies to work. Otherwise, the profit agenda becomes an obstacle to objectivity. Much like how the 1st Amendment informs the rest of the Constitution, this policy sets a clear priority for writing staff, eliminating any doubt.\n\n**2) It is okay to revise/delete published articles.**\n\nOften, we find that previously published articles turn out to be inaccurate or just flat out wrong. As such, writers for The AGAIG Post are required to revise old articles as evidence surfaces. Upon revision of an article, it must then be pushed to the front page again, to avoid the possibility of a writer quietly revising it and then keeping mum.\n\n**3) It is okay to not be the first to publish \"breaking news\", and it is even okay to not publish at all.**\n\nToo often, we've seen news rush to publish without verifying evidence exists. This policy is here to let writers know that there is literally no rush. It doesn't matter if you publish 1 week later or not publish at all, just make sure your writing is surgically precise on empirical truth.\n\nOther agencies are publishing a hugely popular story regarding a rumor with no verifiable source? Ignore it. Every word that makes it onto The AGAIG Post must be verifiable.\n\n**4) \"Weasel words\" are banned. Completely.**\n\nWeasel words like \"some people say\", \"scientists say\", etc. are completely banned from The AGAIG Post. If you do not have a named source, or statistical data to support the assertion, you are not allowed to write about it. Period. Feel free to write \"20% of XYZ group believe...\" and make it a hyperlink to your statistical source.\n\nSimilar \"weasel practices\" such as \"an unnamed source close to the White House has told The AGAIG Post...\" are also banned. Unnamed sources are unacceptable at The AGAIG Post.\n\n**5) Every article must have a link to a data depository included.**\n\nEvery writer is issued an audio recorder. Use these to record statements from named sources. These audio files are then uploaded, in raw unedited format, to the repository for your article. If you conducted your own study and have statistical data, put your data in the repository. If you obtained data from written sources like academic papers, then a link should be included appropriately.\n\n**6) \"Framing the story\" is a fireable offense.**\n\nYour articles should include as little embellishment and unverified opinions as possible. Attempting to frame the story as taught in journalism school is a fireable offense. You're not writing stories. You are writing verifiable fact.\n\nLet's take a recent event and example headlines:\n\n*\"Donald Trump Signs Executive Order Banning Muslims From 7 Countries\"*\n\nThis is framing the story. The POTUS signed an executive order suspending all visas and asylum applications for 7 nations. Whether or not they're Muslims is not part of the headline, because the executive order does not state as such.\n\nIt may be important for readers to know that these 7 nations are predominantly Muslim, and therefore, the EO does affect Muslims. You may convey this by including links to demographic data of these 7 nations and allow readers to make their own conclusions. You should make no attempt to create conclusions for readers.\n\nTherefore, your headline should be:\n\n*\"President Donald Trump Signs Executive Order Suspending Visas And Asylum Applications From Nations Listed In State Department's XYZ List\"*\n\nThe headline is unwieldy, but there is no embellishment, nor are conclusions are made for the reader.\n\n**7) A weekly \"fact check\" meeting will be held.**\n\nThis final policy is here to catch anything else the preceding 6 does not. A weekly \"all hands\" meeting will be held where every word in your writing will be scrutinized by your peers and/or expert guests. You are expected to defend your writing using statements from named sources and statistical data. Failure to do so will result in warnings and eventual termination.\n\n------------------------\n\nI recognize that such a news outlet may have a far smaller viewership than the big boys on the block like Fox, MSNBC, CNN, etc. Therefore, profit margins will be lower.\n\nHell, some glory seeking journalists may outright refuse to work for The AGAIG Post.\n\nHowever, all of that is okay. So long as every word is verifiable, and every assertion is backed up for all of the public to see, no one can accuse The AGAIG Post of being \"fake news\".\n\nThe hope is that such an outlet will be a meeting place for people who hold all kinds of diverse political beliefs. If we can achieve just this, The AGAIG Post will have served its purpose. \n\nToo often we find it difficult to have civil discourse, due to the proliferation of wildly inaccurate information on social media or otherwise. We can't even agree on what the facts are, how are we going to agree on a solution to problems facing the species?\n\nAnyway, this is my small idea. If anyone else has suggestions that will further improve the methodology, please step forward.",

Costs a little more, but you get the cool cover art for your ebook, which is also eminently giftable.\n\nNow you can wander into a bookshop, browse guilt-free, take your purchases to the register and ask for the e-cover version. \n\nwin/win/win",

Someone must have lost their job over this.. right? I could do it 100% times better!\n\nIs there, or has there ever been, a show/game/forum/etc. based on this idea? Create a short task, like design a better UPS truck, and the only people allowed to \"compete\" are people who do something totally unrelated for their job / never studied it? Kind of like an amateur hour league?\n\nIf this doesn't exist, do you think it could be a fun idea for a subreddit? Following the previous example, make a post stating the \"problem\" or question, like, design the next USPS truck, you have one week. At the end of the week, submissions are judged, based on voting and maybe 50% by people in the relevant field, e.g. auto design and mailman. The winner get's fame and fortune, the losers get reminded not to quit their day jobs.\n\nNotes\n\n* timing can be changed, of course, but i didn't see this as being so long or intricate in the execution, just something relatively fun and quick, in order to maintain interest and probability that people will join in. Of course if it would take off it could evolve with peoples wants.\n* which brings me to ideas of projects, well it could just be community sourced thru the reddit.\n\nWould something like that sound like a fun idea to anyone else, or just me?

But, inside the town, everyone moves freely. Mix the town with around 30% convicts, and 70% normal people who are compassionate towards others (and volunteer to participate). Within the borders, nobody is ever required to share whether they are serving a sentence.\n\nThe town could grow ample crops for food, have a church for the top 10 or so denominations, and community centers/activities that are non-religious or directly atheist. Also, free schooling, up to an associates degree level. Unlimited classes, work at your own pace, and opportunities to start over from kindergarten if necessary. This would be available to non-convict citizens as well.\n\nInclude various shops/ businesses, selling useful goods and neat recreational stuff. Guests and non-convict citizens are allowed to come and go freely, but are thoroughly vetted at the gate both ways. Perhaps limit internet access to each home. Something like a 1GB/day limit, to ensure people are more likely to mingle, or at least do something productive. Also, offer ample offline opportunities to learn about whatever is useful, possibly using an internal intranet system.\n\nHave this as an alternative to jail. Minimum stay could be 1 year. At the end of this year, convicts who did well, and are happy participating in their community could be given a chance to move out. They'll be set up with 3 months' rent in a 1-bedroom apartment in a city of their choice, but it must be an area where jobs are attainable. They're also given tons of help in lining up a job that they can do, and that they won't have trouble getting to/from.\n\nPerhaps if jobs become scarce (or start scarce), create a state or city-owned factory to make something. This way, citizens even get a chance to learn some more advanced/lucrative jobs, like machining/ architecture. It would also be nice to try piloting a 6-hour work day, from 8a-2p, with weekends free and holidays.\n\nBenefits: \n\n- It gives convicts a new start on life, without overly burdening society. They get the opportunity to be fully functioning members of a community, and to be respected as human beings. \n\n- It gives law-abiding citizens an opportunity to directly be involved with helping convicts back on their feet, and integrated into society.\n\n- Non-criminals (and criminals) can get free schooling, while also getting an opportunity to work and reconnect with fellow humans who want to connect.\n\n- Those who choose to leave do so with a great resume, with evidence to show that they're a well-rounded, productive person who is willing to try their best.",

So as far as say, YouTube and advertisers know, you saw an ad. But to the user, they saw nothing.\n\nMaybe have the loaded ad be dumped on a sandboxed invisible browser in the background, with audio disabled.\n\nI'm guessing this is going to piss advertisers off, since it fucks with their engagement numbers.

Players will have certain fields of influence such as plagues or the sea, which allow them to use \"belief\" gained from followers to perform miracles. Finally, they may join other gods to create pantheons, which share belief. \n\nWhat do you think of my idea, would you play it, and do you have any ideas for other subreddits where I can flesh this out?",

If you know of morse code you know that it can be used with lights, by turning them on and off at different speeds and combinations you can relay a message. Well what if we built some very large object and had it orbit our sun,  and blocked out our suns light to whoever we are communicating with? Basically they'd see the suns light go on and off and interpret the message (provided we got a key to them somehow). \n\nSo it would have to be really big, but it depends on the receiving ends distance from our sun, and how far the orbit would be. The orbit might take a year or so, so messages might take a really long time to send, but maybe we could get more than one and just space them out in a way that it sends a message faster. ",

            "selftext": "This morning I opened new bag of [Hannahmax Baking cookie chips](http://hannahmax.com/limited-edition-harvest-pumpkin-6oz-4-pack/). The bag is reasealable with notches on both sides of the bag, located above the reseal area. Next to the notches has simple instructions that state \u201cTear Here\u201d. I know from many past experiences, if I follow the instructions and actually tear, the top strip will rip down all the way down to the reclosure and render the feature useless. So instead of tearing, I make a clean cut using scissors. When I used scissors from notch to notch on this bag, the bag didn\u2019t open. I had to make two additional scissor cuts near the enclosure to open the bag. This is a common problem which is not unique to this brand.\n\nMost [tortilla bags](http://quecholli.com/content/964578/IMG_4574.jpg), for example, employ perforated bags that are resealable that work most of the time. Other food packagers should either replace the notches with a (workable) perforation strip or stop using them all together.",

            "selftext": "I find it difficult to use craigslist/letgo/etc because meeting up and flakers waste more time than the item is generally worth. These sites are only useful for really big stuff like couches. I never tried to be an ebay seller because you need to mail stuff and deal with returns and all that, not attractive.\n\nMy idea is that, for a small fee, the app would allow someone who works from home to receive your goods in inventory then when buyers want the item, they just go during \"business hours\" to pick it up after paying over the app. \n\n\nFAQ\n\nQ:What if the middle man is a thief? A: The app records who has the goods, pictures of the goods, and the address of the goods holder. If the middle man steals it, it will be easy to claim to catch them and claim on insurance. \n\nQ:Why should I be a middleman? Sounds like random people come to your house all the time, that's dangerous! A: Being a middle man is a side hustle for those working from home already. So it's like uber without car maintenance. You literally just hold onto stuff.\n\nQ: Sounds more expensive than craigslist. A: It is, but if you value your time it's way easier and still pays more than donation or trash. ",

            "selftext": "At some point, automation is going to kill every single job out there. With the current model that our economy runs on, it will be a literal apocalypse for the average Joe when there are simply no more jobs that need filling.\n\nSo here's an idea on how to transition from our current situation, to one where one may plausibly be financially independent in the future.\n\nWe introduce two new laws:\n\n1) All businesses with revenue above $X million must now be publicly traded on the stock market.\n\n2) Y% of annual profits must be dedicated to paying out dividends to shareholders.\n\nWhat does this mean? This means that every individual has the option of purchasing shares in almost any business they want. With ownership of these shares, you earn dividends over time.\n\nThe values of X and Y are not of particular import, but the idea is to allow really small businesses to remain independent and free from having to deal with shareholder demands (therefore allowing them to innovate without having shareholders panicking), and also to allow shareholders to be paid a \"livable\" dividend. I'm sure economists can do the appropriate math as necessary to determine their values.\n\nWith the above two laws in place, I expect the average Joe to earn far less than if they were working in terms of dollar amount. However, with total automation, I also expect the cost of goods and therefore the cost of living to fall drastically. e.g., instead of $1.00 for a hotdog, it might cost $0.10 instead.\n\nYou as the individual must use your own intellect and wit to determine which shares are worth buying and at what cost.\n\nThis also introduces a nice side effect of having most of the means of production be owned by average citizens, instead of just oligarchs. However, it also avoids the pitfalls of a centrally planned economy.\n\nIt's a thought I had earlier today while on a boring highway trip. But I don't see the pitfalls of this idea so far.\n\nReddit, please attack this idea. Tear it to shreds.",

Rather, they do all of the cleaning/restocking/repairs themselves. This means they must spend time and money purchasing the consumable goods that are needed and also run the risk of having the cost of these goods cut into the profits of their vacation rental business. We aim to reduce this burden by providing a simple and cost effective method to keep vacation rental owners supplied with the consumable goods that must be restocked in between guests.\n\nProperty owners can find everything they need on one website at competitive prices. The items are shipped directly to the property owner in one shipment. No need to drive to the store. No need for coupon cutting. No need to purchase from multiple retailers to find all of the necessary items. \n\nMany vacation rental properties have seasonal ebb and flow in business volume. It can be fairly predictable. For property owners who understand the amount of goods they typically need, recurring orders can be established. The owner will selects the items they want and how often they want them. Automatic shipments will be sent directly to the property owner without the need to remember to order each month. The owner can stop focusing on the minor (but necessary) task of procuring the consumable goods that they need. \n\nTL;DR\nDirect shipment of consumable goods for vacation rental properties, eliminating the need for shopping around and reducing the impact of consumable goods cost on the property owners' bottom line.\n ",

It could also be triggered by a button press.\n\nIt wouldn't need as much technology as a full self-driving car because it would be traveling slowly (<5 mph) only at night, and it would be programmed to follow only low-traffic roads along the curb wherever possible. For safety, it would essentially follow the patterns of a pedestrian, using crosswalks and sidewalks.\n\nA collection point would be a shipping-container-sized garbage compactor, which would be trucked away when full. The collection point would swap out any low-battery units for full ones and charge them as needed.\n\nThis would save the expense of huge heavy polluting trucks driving garbage all over the place, reduce the need for garbage drivers, and allow households to only send their garbage away when actually full.",

Below is a brief summary of our project,\n\nOur capstone project is a discussion platform to bring together idea-creators and content-creators where they will be able to collaborate on the development of a project. When an online community brainstorms ideas or showcases the content that they have created, it can lead to an unorganized mess; our product aims to put organization tools to this discussion process, to enable the community to more easily integrate the best discussion into the development of their project.\n\nI want to kindly ask any of you to fill out our survey. Its short(6 questions) asks your age group, if you are a student and 4 questions relating to what you do and don't like about related platforms.\n\nUltimately this project is for marks but we would like to see if there is an actual market for this sort of product and if there are features you would like to see implemented.\n\nSurvey Link, https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/JVFRZHL\n\nThank you for those who have taken the time to complete the survey!\n",

I've put my alarm on the other side of the room but that doesn't get This is for anyone with similar problems waking up or staying up.\n\n\nand/or anyone who just wants something that will get you out of bed, and awake.\n\n\n**IDEA**  \nI'm working on creating a thin hrm wrist strap that communicates wirelessly with an alarm clock.\n\n\nyou wear a small comfy wrist band heart-rate-monitor to sleep. This wirelessly communicates with your alarm clock. Your alarm clock goes off at your set time and wont stop until you reach a custom target heart rate (based on health, age, fitness level, resting heart rate, etc..)\n\n\n1. Set your alarm\n\n\n2. Set your target bpm *(lets say something between 100-150)*\n\n\n3. Go to sleep with the wristband on.\n\n\n4. The alarm sounds at your desired time, *and slowly gets louder until your heart rate starts to go up.*\n\n\n5. Start doing warm-up level exercises to increase your heart rate *(jog in place, jumping jacks, high knees, bodyweight squats, pushups whatever the hell you want)*\n\n\n6. As your bpm rises toward your target heart rate, the alarm fades away.\n\n\n7. In a couple minutes you achieve your target heart rate and the alarm turns off, (maybe a nice little 'have a nice day' message to let you know you're done)\n\n\nNow your heart rate is elevated, your blood is flowing, your mind and body are awake and best of all, your feeling of crippling fatigue is ignorable or has vanished completely. \n\n\n**END OF IDEA**\n\n\n\n*this could be used with a fit-bit but not everyone wants a fit bit (I never, ever see myself owning one) plus they're expensive if you want one with a hrm in it.*\n\n\n*if you forget to put your hrm on just put it on when you wake up. (having it on during sleep will just speed up the whole process)*\n\n\n\n**Could you see yourself using this or recommending it to someone?**\n\n\n\n**or is it trash?**\n",

Forums could even consist of ways for candidates or even office holders to communicate with their constituents directly and in real time and perhaps a reddit gold/upvote type option could exist to make small contributions. This could spur engagement in politics for many people and on top of that it can help gradually break down the insider natured barriers of Washington that keep so many out and contributes to a general societal apathy towards politics. Organized fact checking can be utilized to keep discussion meaningful and well, factual. One issue to be worked out perhaps would be any applied biases by whoever the \"fact checkers\" are but perhaps that can be sorted by delegating that work to an outside independent source, something certainly to be hashed out. The power of crowd funding has been proven before and if it can be applied to political movements/leaders it certainly presents an alternative to the failing lobbyist/special interest driven system we live under today. Perhaps such a system can have an interesting effect on our political process if it where to gain traction? Could it facilitate debates in a meaningful way beneficial to both sides of the argument and the public watching? Maybe it could even provide a place for new entire political parties to grow?",

            "selftext": "The idea I had was instead of putting the minimum wage on the federal stage, what if we put it on a county stage? What if in a world where we were able to get our local county or city government to raise the minimum wage for workers in an attempt to bring lower wage workers into dying markets and communities. All over the Midwest and all over the East Coast of the United States, we can see cities dying because of urbanization. Urbanized cities have more opportunities for work. What if those cities raised the minimum wage to whatever they needed it to be in order to bring in more workers to their community. While the workers would probably be poor, because of the higher wages and the lower cost of living of the smaller communities it would bring an environment  for lower income families to thrive. It would immediately improve the standard of life for those in the communities that change, and create a market that brings in more consumers to those communities by bringing in working families to those communities. \n\nIt has been long known, the best way to make money is off of people who don't have much. They have no choice other than to buy from Walmart and McDonald's, because they don't make enough to put healthy food in their diet and to get long lasting expensive products in their home.\n\nBy smaller communities giving larger pay, it gives an incentive for families to move to those areas. By giving them higher pay, it allows those consumers to lead healthier lives and have a higher standard of life.\n\nIn the short run, you see more urban people moving to rural areas, and those areas seeing more consumerism in local markets.\n\nIn the long run, these rural areas could cause a gap in urban areas as their economy grows and the urban ones shrink. This leading to a competition between these rural areas and the urban ones, pushing up the minimum wage.\n\nWhile the urban areas might eventually win this competition, the rural areas get a spike in growth and possibly a foothold with people who move and prefer the lifestyle they adopt there. Also, the minimum wage gets raised in the same way stores next door to each other compete for milk prices. \n\nIt promotes local economy, higher minimum wage, a raise in the  standard of life for both people living in rural areas, and people moving into rural areas. Finally it creates an environment where capitalism isn't compromised, and the people on the lower end of the totem pole win. The competition between counties and cities would raise minimum wage and would drive out large corporations while supporting poor families, and local business owners. \n\nThis is just an idea, I would love to know what any of you think. If you find flaws in it, let me know so I can fine tune it, and maybe find an almost perfect solution to the low wage problem that plagues the country. ",

            "selftext": "First you just train your dog to follow leash commands, not included. Such as pull to the right mean go right, left means left, pull back means slow down or two tugs is sit. Etc.\n\nThis device would sit on the dogs back attached like a harness with three connecting straps leading to the dogs collar on the left, top, and right. It would have three small motorized wenches attached to these connection points on the harness side. When the wenches are activated via an app or dedicated controlled they reel in a little bit simulating a pull on the collar. Thus when you hit the back button the connecting strap on the top of the collar is pulled back telling the dog to slow down/sit, the right button is pushed the right strap is pulled. (Of course safety thresholds are implemented so dogs are being choked out...)\n\nThis could allow for lazy remote dog walking if you're handicapped or elderly, controlling multiple dogs at once,  stopping dogs from pulling you around since you're not connected, or just having a fun remote controlled dog",

            "selftext": "Hi lightbulb, I'm excited to share my attempt at bringing this sub's Ivy Desktop App idea to fruition.\n\nThe idea originally was for ivy to grow around files on your desktop as they go untouched to help promote a less cluttered desktop by pointing out rarely used items. I thought this idea was awesome and immediately went into research mode. After spending a good chunk of my free time for a while tinkering, I decided that the idea in its purest form is not something I'm capable of, but that I could definitely create an app to the same effect.\n\nMy macOS app is called dustpan. It periodically dusts your desktop, moving all files that have not been recently used (recently is by default a week, but is customizable) to the dustpan, where they can be accessed or moved at will. Dustpan declutters your desktop without deleting anything, messing with your desktop folders, or affecting your important, frequently-used files at all.\n\n[Please check out what I made here!](https://dustpan.github.io/)\n\nI apologize that it's not completely free. I made it 99 cents for now as otherwise I would be losing money due to hosting and etc., and as a college kid that's not really an option right now.\n\nTLDR: kinda made one of the sub's top ideas, check it out pls\n\nThanks :)\n",

            "selftext": "One problem with elections is the fact that, inevitably, some people just don't get represented. If your district is a consistent 60/40 split for one party, that means 40% of your populace have no hope of ever being represented. That's just not cool. It also means that the 60% majority ends up subdividing, because to win the general election, all you really have to do is win the primary, so whoever can get half of the 60% wins, and so on down. Appeal to the loudest minority in your party, and you win the whole district, and now you're beholden to that minority to maintain power. You end up with increasingly extreme districts, because they can never flip, and because nobody will cross party lines to try to form a coalition. There are ways around this kind of thing, like having the districts drawn by a neutral party, or by an algorthm, or just doing away with districts entirely and using proportional representation. But if your district is the entire state, none of those work.\n\nInstead, we should look at this like a signal processing problem. The votes cast make a vector of percentages for each candidate; call it a point in an (N-1)-dimensional space, where there are N candidates. So if there are three candidates, the result is a point within a 3-dimensional space, on the particular triangular plane on which all the coordinates add to 100%. But the actual outcome of the election is inevitably a unit vector for one of those three dimensions, because we can only elect a discrete, integral human being. (If only.) So the entire concept introduces error; the result is not what the people actually voted for, just the closest available approximation.\n\nThis is identical to quantization error in signal processing. My computer might only be able to store the values 0 and 1, for example. How can it possibly represent a string of values that are all 0.2? Well one way is to just snap to the nearest value, and say \"0\" every time. But that really doesn't represent what's actually happening. A more accurate way is dithering. You insert some guassian noise on top of each .2, such that you get 0 80% of the time, and 1 20% of the time. On average, you get .2, and since the noise is gaussian there's no additional pattern injected onto the signal.\n\nSo on the election results with N candidates, you generate a gaussian PDF with u=0 and... some standard deviation I haven't defined yet. You sample from that function for N-1 candidates, which increases or decreases their vote totals by some amount. The remaining candidate gets adjusted such that the total makes 100%.\n\nSo a district that's 60/40 for one party could end up with that party winning 60% of the time, and the other party winning 40% of the time. And that seems to fix a lot of problems. You don't end up with an elected official having the attitude that they can ignore huge numbers of people because they have a safe majority; one more vote than the next guy may not be enough any more. The fact that it's always possible to lose unless you have literally 100% of the vote means that every vote matters.",

But of course we all agree that ebooks make searching for contents possible in a way that even the best printed index can't achieve.\n\nFlexible thin films are just about a thing these days. So I submit the idea of sticking a thin touch sensitive display onto the inside front or rear cover of a book, via which reader could perform a text search against the electronic version of the book. \n\nSimple concept, not quite so simple to implement but probably not all that hard, either. The cost of having to ship a display with every book is the obvious drawback. Why not just have one display that you share across books?\n\nWell, that's obviously the  \"possible right now\" solution - carrying around both a book and separate device for searching, but something about having the electronic index built into the cover of the physical book appeals to me. It would also help to ensure that the version of the book being electronically searched matches the version of the printed book, no need to worry that your ebook page numbers don't match your physical page numbers, or that you have different editions, etc.",

I don\u2019t think it should be too organized, but I struggle to think of a way to make sure everyone gets a turn and to let people know when it\u2019s their turn. The only way I can think of would be to number people 1 through 60. I don\u2019t think people should be judged though. It\u2019s not a competition. After it\u2019s over, people could discard their numbers or keep them if they want. I think the party would be sufficiently started by the time it was over. Everyone would have drank at least 5 beers, and, I think, be feeling much more confident than usual after showing out and having everyone (59 hype men) cheer them on as they danced. Maybe there could be an announcer that says the next person\u2019s name or number, but I feel like that would be too much pressure.

I thought this idea was awesome and immediately went into research mode. After spending a good chunk of my free time for a while tinkering, I decided that the idea in its purest form is not something I'm capable of, but that I could definitely create an app to the same effect.\r\n\r\nMy macOS app is called dustpan. It periodically dusts your desktop, moving all files that have not been recently used (recently is by default a week, but is customizable) to the dustpan, where they can be accessed or moved at will. Dustpan declutters your desktop without deleting anything, messing with your desktop folders, or affecting your important, frequently-used files at all.\r\n\r\nThanks!",

            "selftext": "So I got to thinking, as an avid fan of blooper reels and outtakes, why isn't there a website for all blooper reels? It could be like a website devoted to uploading blooper reels from movies, TV shows, and even porn DVDs. Of course I know the companies would lose revenue from the lack of DVD sales, but with more people streaming movies, either through services such as Netflix or other options, DVDs and Blu-Rays are already becoming almost obsolete. I also know that some companies post outtakes on YouTube, but it's not that often and when they do, I feel like they only post portions of it or clips. Even on EFukt, most of what is up there are just blooper clips or compilations from various porn movies. I don't think I've ever seen a proper blooper reel from a porn DVD online. I really wish there was a website that could upload and archive every blooper reel out there and even have it so people could submit them because it would obviously be very hard for one person or even a small group of people to upload every single one ever.

To prevent the hangers from getting disorganized or tangles, it has the basic coat hanger design but there is no hook at the top anymore, its a small curve facing upwards with a magnet overlapping it that you can easily just stick to your bar.

            "selftext": "Hey guys! So I was eating my discount \"after v-day candy\" and I saw the messages on them and I started seeing a game form and sooner or later, I have made an almost fun game of Truth or Dare entirely with those famous chalky treats. So here's the starting idea for my sweet remix of Truth or Dare for the sour days after Valentine's! \n\nSo the first things you would need would be Conversation hearts, like a whole big 8 oz bag or a bunch of boxes, some friends you like and know a lot about and 3 bowls. 1 of the bowls, you will divide the hearts that say: \"Dare Ya\" and \"Be True\", this will be a twist on Truth or Dare, leaving it to fate whether you get Truth or Dare. The 2 other bowls, you will divide the corresponding \"Truth\" Or \"Dare\" Hearts, their category and meaning is as follows:\n\n(these are the ones which I have seen and matched corresponding actions with thus far but I am open to suggestions and other messages I didn't list)(Pictured here: https://gyazo.com/6eb8bc8b5a9abb37e0dde0024cbc856a ) (I moved some around from what is pictured)\n\n**\"Dare Ya\" Dares:** \n\n-\"Crazy 4 u\" - You or your friends get to choose one crazy thing for to do\n\n-\"Just One\" - Your friends have to pick one thing in the house you can eat (it doesnt have to be gross but its encouraged. and it can't be the hearts or something the person is allergic to).\n\n-\"I.M Sure\" - Your friends pick someone in your phone to \"I.M.\" or text.\n\n-\"LOL\" - Make someone laugh\n\n-\"Mad 4 You\" - Text or call someone and act mad at them!\n\n-\"Too Hot\" - Eat something spicy or put your hand under hot water for 10 seconds.\n\n-\"Too Cool\" - Hold an ice cube in your mouth for 30 seconds or run your hand under ice cold water for a whole minute.\n\n-\"Yes\" - Your friends can come up with any dare and you have to do it!\n\n-\"Mi Amor\" - Pick a language you don't know and learn how to say a flirtatious line.\n\n-\"XOXO\" - Out of the people in the room, you have to pick one person to kiss, and one person to hug\n\n-\"Hey You\" - You can direct a dare on anyone you please!\n\n-\"You Rock\" - Pick a head-banging song and rock out your heart out! Perform a high energy rock show!\n \n **\"Be True\" Truths:**\n\n-\"My Boy\" - Tell everyone your favorite boy in your life right now\n\n-\"My Girl\" - Tell everyone your favorite girl in your life right now\n\n-\"Soulmate\" - Tell everyone who you feel like is your soulmate or who your soulmate would be like.\n\n-\"Kiss me\" - Tell everyone who you want to kiss most!\n\n-\"My Hero\" - Tell everyone someone you idolize!\n\n-\"So Fine\" - Tell everyone who you think is the most attractive to you\n\n-\"First Kiss\" - Tell everyone about your first kiss!\n\n-\"BFF\" - Tell everyone who your BFF is and why\n\n-\"Get Real\" - Tell everyone a super serious story\n\n-\"Awesome\" - Tell an awe striking story\n\n-\"My Love\" - Tell everyone a celeberity you love\n\n-\"Luv Me\" - Tell everyone someone you wished loved you\n\n-\"I \u2764 You\" - Tell everyone a heart warming story!\n\nThese are \"Wild Cards\" and when you get them, you get to either keep them, or use them whenever you please.\n\n **Wild Cards:**\n\n-\"Be Mine\"/ \"Ur Mine\" - You can pick anyone in the room and any dare they get next, is something they pick out instead\n\n-\"Urs 4 ever\" - Like \"Be Mine\"/\"Ur Mine\" but you can pick a dare for every one who gets a dare for 4 turns\n\n-\"Gotcha\" - Pick another dare and you get to pick someone to do it\"\n\n-\"See ya\"- A card you can play where you can pass up on a dare\n\n-\"Don't Tell\" - A card you can play where you can pass up on a truth\n\n-\"No way\" - A card you can play where you can pass up on a Truth or a Dare\n\nThis is all I could come up with but I really wanted to write this down, show the world and see what they think! But feel free to improve on this idea, add any hearts you would think would make great suggestions or any other ideas for the meaning of the hearts or anyway to spice up or critique the game idea. ",

            "selftext": "I think this could be a fun new sport and an entire industry could be built around it.  Training centers (Dojos) teaching different weapons techniques, weapon and protective suit/helmet manufacturers..\n\nSo you fight/duel with an opponent using softer, dull versions of melee weapons:  medieval broadswords, maces, axes, katanas, etc.  \n\nThe weapons are wrapped or coated with a material which triggers your enemy's suit to constrict or freeze when they touch.  \n\nThe suits use those fibers and materials which constrict when electrified (think of that scene in Batman Begins when Morgan Freeman shows Bale how his gliding cape will work).  \n\nIf I slice or stab your arm, your arm can no longer move.  If I stab your head/helmet (like a kendo helmet, but stronger) your entire suit freezes and you're \"dead\".  \n\nSame with a strong stab to the chest.  \n\nThere will be different magnitudes of damage depending on the force of impact from the weapon, and whether it was a stab or slice or blunt strike (from a dull weapon like a mace or warhammer).\n\nSo if you barely slice at my leg, I'll still be able to use my leg, but it will be partially disabled (constricted/frozen).  \n\nIf you hack my upper arm with the edge of your broadsword my arm freezes completely, i.e. you cut off my arm.  A severe wound like this also affects other parts of my body because having an arm hacked off will make everything start going to pot.   So your legs and torso will be partially disabled.  And after a time you'll be totally done because you've \"bled out\".  \n\nSo you could setup 1v1 duels, or re-enactment history gurus could do huge team battles simulating famous historical battles (Braveheart/300/Troy).  Special arrows could be used for castle archers.\n\nThis could be an Olympic sport!  \n\nAgain the helmets will be strong enough to protect against any head trauma or pointed objects causing injury.  And the suits will be heavily padded so you're arm isn't broken when struck by a sword.  \n\nBut in the undamaged/unconstricted state your suit needs to have freedom of motion.  So the suit can't be completely padded so you feel nothing.  You'll get bruises similar to paintball.  You won't want to get stabbed, but it won't cause agonizing pain or serious injury.   \n\nI thought this was a neat idea.  What do you think?  Is anything like this possible?",

(Going to sell it for a dollar, donate the money and publish the receipts)\nIts going to be short (not sure how long it will take) that will concentrate on current global issues, how we got here and where we are going. And untangling the web of complexity that we weave on this little blue dot we live on.\n\nI feel like everyone talks about issues im going to try to confront in this book, but we dont really take a step back and look at where we actually are. We can get so tangled up in our lives that we lose perspective on what is really happening. Individuals need direction, so do countries and movements.\n\nI have a small excerpt i've just completed but I dont know if it will resonate with anyone. After re-reading, its rather patriotic, so I dont know what kind of reaction that will garner. Take a read and let me know If I should continue on this work.\n\nThis small section is at the beginning and making observations about where we are at the moment from the perspective of an optimistic citizen. It will lead into what our responsibilities are as citizens, what should we come to expect of others and ourselves, and if we've lived up to the expectations of past generations. Also, If not how can we, and how do we stay true to the human spirit.\nLet me know if I should continue, change something or just forget any ideas i've had of writing (hahaha)\n\n\"Most countries are not all that different from each other. Why is the USA the way it is then? The secret about the United States is that it is an experiment, a cultural experiment. The USA represents the hopes and dreams of the world. A place that was meant to be where a man can make what he's entitled to, and live well on it. A place where he can raise a family, and no matter where he's originally from identify with his neighbor. Whether he be of a different race or religion he lives in his new identity as an American. So has the American dream measured up? Or has it died in practice? Most people don't come to the United States to destroy it despite popular belief, but there is a silent constituent of people who are here who don't care about it. The USA is a microcosm of the world if globalism were to reign free. There is the potential for great danger, but opportunity seems to knock at the door when you least prepared. The USA is rife with problems but it has such great potential. Where did the dreamers go? Where have our morals gone? What have we become. Are we destined to destitution? Should we look at the ground as our final resting place or to the stars as our eternal destiny? The future of everything depends on right now. But the question is can right now depend on you?\"\n\nIm hoping a few people read this and go, \u201cAha! This person gets it.\u201d but all we can do is hope for the best and prepare for the worst. :)\n\nI plan on releasing this under a pseudonym. It would be a neat idea to crowdsource one! Any Ideas??? Let me know. Thank you in advance for all of your replies.\n",

It wouldn't have to be just for transgenders needing a friend to escort them to the bathroom, but any situation that is not ok. I know I'm one of the many that, if I had this, would step in to help stop prejudice/violence/hate crimes.\n\nSomething like this probably already exists, but it'd be nice to have a really simply app that has your picture and will pop up on other user's phone within ~1 mile radius with like 3 different levels of alert: I just don't feel ok being alone, I need someone to intercept, I need you to call 911.\n\nWith all the turmoil going on in our world, being afraid to go pee should be the least of our worries.

            "selftext": "> IDEA 1 - ANCIENT SUPERSOLDIER HAREM\n\n\nThe basic premise starts off as you'd expect: a lonely permavirgin highschooler is about to graduate from HS without ever having been intimate or had a girlfriend. One weekend, a massive storm hits, and he is forced to go to his uncle's farm to get some equipment (chainsaw, ATV, etc) to clean up around his house. While there, he stumbles upon a glowing stone that was unearthed during the storm. Upon grabbing it, he is teleported into an ancient spacecraft buried a few miles below his uncle's farm. Inside this craft, he finds several cute/sexy girls all being held in suspended animation. The stone shatters in his hands into a million fragments that dig into his skin, and in his panic, he accidentally unlocks one of the girls' containers. She's naked, the typical hijinks ensue, but it turns out they're humans from an ancient non-Earth civilization. Humans were engineered by aliens and used as soldiers for their genetic superiority millions of years ago, but their spaceship crashed during a war. The girls, the male commander, and their AI helper unit were left in stasis for millions of years.\n\n\nOver the course of time, MC helps first girl restore power to the ship while breaking the girls into modern human life one at a time. Eventually, the commander man buys a mansion just down the street from MC and forces him to move in to help train his newfound supersoldier cyber-suit abilities. With a pool, a sauna, and the commander's frat boy, drunkard tendencies, MC ends up in tantalizing and romantic situations alike as he trains to wield his newfound powers. Over time, antagonistic humans show up and give the show its dramatic elements in between the typical romantic and sexy-time ecchi plots. These villains would include 1) a traitorous alien and his human lackeys as the first boss 2) extraterrestrial humans based on the Greek and Norse gods who come to war with one another over the newly-rediscovered planet Earth 3) self-programming killbot made of holy metals (whole other plot element to that, can explain if anyone is interested), and also many others. Would basically be high-tech and science-style Highschool DxD. \n\n\nHarem would include:\n\n\n- Mean-spirited redhead loli\n\n\n- Cute, shy blonde girl (first girl)\n\n\n- Tan brunette athletic girl who comes on to MC hard\n\n\n- Ara-ara second-in-command girl who teaches MC at first but slowly becomes attracted to him\n\n\n- Vicious and competitive enemy girl who gets defeated and slowly warms up to the MC\n\n\n\n\n--\n\n\n> IDEA 2 - INTERDIMENSIONAL HAREM\n\n\nMC is basically the same guy, but instead of ancient alien harem, he hops timelines. Essentially, MC wakes up in his bed one morning with a hot girl out of the blue. Over the course of the day, he finds out she's actually his alternate timeline self and he woke up in another timeline, the genderswap universe. The next day, they wake up in his home dimension, and both are visited by a wise old sage (an older alternate version of the MC) who informs them they are the nexus points of the multiverse. Evils are sprouting up across time and space, and the MC and FemC are tasked with gathering abilities from alternate versions of themselves (fallen and living) to combat these threats. MC and FemC obtain technology gauntlets that allow them to store powers and abilities from alternate versions of themselves and possibly even summon them directly. \n\n\nNaturally, MC is a massive loser in his own timeline, but by visiting other dimensions (harem worlds, genderswap realities, hentai-based realities, neko girl worlds, worlds where he tragically died, etc), he ends up amassing a harem of girls he knows in his world that rejected or ignored him but have been altered by these other timelines in such a way that they fall in love with him. You could have every girl parody some kind of anime or video game in some way or parody a trope.\n\n\nComedy and drama would come from the cast exploring these other worlds and the weirdness that would ensue.\n\n\nHarem would include:\n\n\n- FemC could open up an interesting discussion about romancing yourself\n\n\n- Cardgame world girl\n\n\n- Traditional tsundere\n\n\n- Neko girls or awoos\n\n\n- Girls he already knows from hentai worlds\n\n\n- Alien girls\n\n\n- Chibi girls\n\n\n- etc etc\n\n\n--\n\nIt probably sounds weird to say it, but I mostly watch harem/ecchi shows. I like traditional shonen, but most of the time I'd prefer a harem/ecchi combo above anything. A lot of the plots end up cookie cutter; that's not to say I don't still enjoy those bland shows, but it means I often end up envisioning these stories in my head that no one ever seems to explore.

However, it probably isn't easily reproducible. Especially so by \"non-developers\" (but could potentially be useful to them).\n\nLet's use Dropbox as an example. Before that, some used 'rsync' to sync files between two or more computers. Although this works pretty well, it isn't really usable by users who aren't keen about terminals. But now, with Dropbox anyone can do so with ease.\n\nAnother thing could be using Cron as daily reminders or monitoring if a website is still up every second and perform an action if not.\n\nLooking forward to interesting answers and thank you for your time and input in advance!",

            "selftext": "I came up with this game when I was a teenager.  Actually it just sort of evolved on its own.\n\nMy friends and I were all sleeping in the same room.  Typical 13 year old sleepover setup.  My mom had a record player and a neglected stack of beat up scratched up 45s in the corner. I thought it would be fun to get a good jump scare out of the guys so I whipped one into the wall.  It gave a loud clunk and everyone was freaking out, saying WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT?  As I'm laughing, I hear whizzing through the air as it comes flying back.  It hits me, and it hurts.  Not much, but enough to piss me off.  \n\nIt's pitch black, I have no idea who threw it, but *I heard it hissing through the air toward me so I had a general direction.*\n\nI returned fire with another, then threw the original out again.  Pretty soon records were flying all over the room at mach 2 and mach 3 speeds.  When one fell, someone would pick it up and return fire.  Then fire at others. Records were shattering and raining down shrapnel.  I gashed my friend Matt's head, not deeply, but it bled quite a bit.  Very quickly we went from laughter and raucusness down to silence.  And we realized this was a game better played in silence.  \n\nWhhhhiiiiiiiirrrr (CRASH)\n\n\nwhhhHIIIIIIRRR (CRASH)\n\nAHH!  \n\nWHIIRRR WHIIRR WHIRRR (THUMP THUMP THUMP) \n\nAnd the game was understood.  You made a sound, people heard you.  If people heard you, you got beaned.  You could throw out feelers to try to scare a yelp out.  So obviously, we named it RADAR.  In reality it would more accurately be called \"EchoLocation\" but that just doesn't have the same fun to it.\n\nIn later years, realizing the value of even old beat up records, we started using our fucked up stockpiles of scratched to hell CDRs.  Later after we would just pick up a stack of 100, cheap as they were.  They don't have the same heft as a record, and require a bit more skill to throw hard enough to be scary, but it's still Radar.  We still draw blood.  It's still fuckloads of fun.\n\nJust figured I'd share with everyone.  It's a fun game with an element of slight danger (YOU COULD PUT AN EYE OUT!) \n\nWe don't even announce it anymore, we'll just wait till it's night time and kill the breakers.  Everyone knows what's up when they hear the first whiiiRRRRR.\n",

You might rotate a full cycloid around its center (so that point A and Point B make one circular grind-rail edge) to make a circular bowl. Perhaps you could rotate a cycloid around an arbitrary point to make a \"Half-torus bowl\" with a flat, elevated area in the middle, and 2 different grind-rails.\n\nAnyway, skaters and bmx bikers should try out some obscure, but simple, geometric curves. Multi-variable descriptions of a surface too. Why not?",

I have an idea that might fix that, although it might already exist.\n\nBasically, when the cycle begins, the dryer will set off an led flash (inside the drum) like a camera flash, and there will be an LDR (light dependant resistor), also in the drum that would output a signal that would vary depending on how much light was reflected or absorbed by the clothes. With that, the dryer could determine how dark the clothes are and could adjust the cycle accordingly. ",

You would either need a camera that records and analyze on its own or special cards. Ill go through pros/cons in regards to either method.\nCamera Pros\nPossibly less of a privacy issue i.e. the camera can be used to only view your cards and not the whole table's\nCons\nProbably more prone to errors in analytics considering you don't really want to mark the cards.\nWould most likely cost more\n\nSpecial Cards Pros\nDepending on how we change the cards could make it much more accurate than a camera such as smart cards\nCons\nPrivacy. It would be difficult/impracticable to only track one player\nBulk/fake/odd felling cards. Smart cards could weigh more or be bulkier. Shuffling could also be an issue.\nWearing. Seeing how fast normal cards wear down I would imagine smarts cards wouldn't last long. Unless they're cheap most wont spend the money for something that wont last long.\n\nI just thought it was an interesting idea. Let me know what you think.\n",

            "selftext": "tl;dr - My friend and I are starting a subscription dinner delivery service, and we want to know about people's eating habits. If you could answer the 4 questions in bold below, we would really appreciate it!\n\n**1. Do you prefer not cooking? Why or why not?**\n**2. Do you mind eating the same food on a weekly basis, at least for some meals? Why or why not?**\n**3. Would you be willing to pick what you eat, and when you would eat it, 1-4 weeks in advance, at least for some meals? Why or why not?**\n**4. Would you be willing to pay $10 for dinner delivered to your home, at least for some meals? Why or why not?**\n\nHi r/Lightbulb, my friend and I are working on a subscription dinner delivery service. We've already run it by some friends of ours, but we'd like some feedback from the larger community. Thanks! \n\nSo I hate cooking, but I can't afford to eat out for dinner daily. On weekdays I don't need anything fancy, I just want a healthy, 700-calorie meal. I suspect there are a lot of people like me, which is why we're working on a subscription dinner delivery service.\n\nIt works like this:\n- It costs $10 per meal.\n- We have a menu of 7 dishes, one for each day of the week. \n- The food would be simple but tasty, things like burrito bowls, chicken tikka / red curry with rice.\n- Each meal is 600-700 calories.\n- The customer selects what items they want a month (4 weeks) at a time. The minimum is 1 order per week, so 4 orders for a month.\n- The customer has to place their orders for the month a week before the start of the monthly subscription period. So if I want to start getting food from March 21, I need to place my orders for March 21 - April 18 (4 weeks) by March 14 (1 week before).\n- We deliver during delivery windows of a half hour. So your food will come anytime between say 7-7:30. The customer selects the delivery windows when placing the order.\n\nObviously, we're making some big assumptions about people's eating habits, which we'd like to validate. If you could answer the 4 questions listed above, that would be great!\n\nThank you very much! This is the first time my friend and I have started a business, so any and all feedback and criticism is welcomed.",

This country has an assortment of potential republican structures to choose from, some more authoritarian than others (for the range of functions a company can serve, and all having appropriate benefits and government protocols) and some only available to companies of certain sizes or trades (for example, small businesses with relatively few employees can be near-dictatorships, because the effect would be relatively small, and you want to incentivize entrepreneurship in the first place). This way, since the CEO's are much more beholden to most of the actual people in the company, and it benefits the most people more often.\nAny holes you would like to point out or questions you would like to ask?",

You would have a mobile app where you can set your preferences and when the wearable buzzes, you can try to discover what and who you might have been matched with. Great for conversation starters. Like I could for example set my app to \"single and looking {criteria}\" and it buzzes when someone is nearby. I notice she has a wearable and talk to her, buy her a drink, etc. Dating would just be one aspect; you can use it for anything... maybe you want it to buzz whenever someone is a huge fan of your favorite sports team, or you both really love sappy romance films, or whatever. Basically it's a social device to give you a small idea of what would make your compatible with someone else so you can strike up a conversation. The mobile app could even give you helpful hints like when you have a lot of different criteria, it would say you matched based on one of the following {A, B or C} to help narrow it down.",

Everyone who wants to participate needs to create a new account and is allowed to post a maximum of ten comments per day. No posts, because I think that would encourage low-effort reposting. When the challenge is over, everyone posts their account to the \"Results\"-thread, where a bot will print the statistics of each user. The user with the most comment karma wins.\n\n The twist: every comment must meet a special criteria, which is defined before the challenge starts.

            "selftext": "The goal of the application is to 1. provide an improved dating experience and 2. sustain the business.\n\nTinder is providing a poor experience to users because, like mobile gaming apps, the motivation to pay is derived from frustration rather than value added. The Tinder platform does not produce enough value added for it's users to justify the pricetag. The application itself is really nothing more than an image hosting site with a built in chat app. \n\n\nDespite the ease of creating tinder-like platforms, Tinder remains  king. The large reason for this is marketing and momentum. Who want's to sign up for hundreds of dating apps? \n\nThe answer is in marketing and improved value added for users.\n\nValue Added:\n\nMales users need more transparency in their match ranking and personal metrics. Why am I getting no matches? It's because your matches are being held back until you buy boost. Or because you need a haircut. Matching algorithms will be published as well as the algorithm that determines how often you show up and when. It's open source, so everything will be published but I wanted to highlight that portion.\n\n\nFemale users need more legitimate feedback on who finds them attractive. What's the point of swiping if every right swipe is a match? Female user's biggest complaint seems to be rude and aggressive men. Not much to do their except penalize men for being reported. Quick feedback on the cause/effect relationship of rude behavior should reduce this as well as sending perpetual rude males into the \"bot zone\" where all their matches are bots.\n\n\nMarketing:\n\nThe perfect app with no users is a bad app. Since this would be built without commercial investors wanting a return, marketing costs must be minimized. Swiping will cost you in some form of virtual currency. You get more money by having friends sign up (done but it works), you also get money by donating to causes. People mind less if they donate to charity. This app will take a small fee from those donations and use it to buy advertisements. You can also choose to buy currency. When accounts are deleted or sent to the bot zone, the currency spent on them gets refunded, so don't worry about bots.  \n",

            "selftext": "\"The reason that the rich were so rich, Vimes reasoned, was because they managed to spend less money.\n\nTake boots, for example. He earned thirty-eight dollars a month plus allowances. A really good pair of leather boots cost fifty dollars. But an affordable pair of boots, which were sort of OK for a season or two and then leaked like hell when the cardboard gave out, cost about ten dollars. Those were the kind of boots Vimes always bought, and wore until the soles were so thin that he could tell where he was in Ankh-Morpork on a foggy night by the feel of the cobbles.\n\nBut the thing was that good boots lasted for years and years. A man who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots that\u2019d still be keeping his feet dry in ten years\u2019 time, while the poor man who could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred dollars on boots in the same time and would still have wet feet.\n\nThis was the Captain Samuel Vimes \u2018Boots\u2019 theory of socioeconomic unfairness.\"\n\nTerry Pratchett in *Men at Arms*.\n\nBeing poor sucks. You want to buy the deals but you can't because you don't have the cash. Now what if there was a way to use collateralized loans, like how Pawn Shops operate, to buy food in bulk, like at Costco? Well now you can!\n\nBy having people take out loans on their possessions, you can offer them bulk deals on food products sold in your store. Your profit margins would be guaranteed by the items that you have on the loan, though they would pay interest to keep their possessions; and people who have bad credit are able to get food at a price that will help them get out of poverty.  This idea isn't for the cutthroat capitalist simply because you aren't trying to squeeze the desperate for everything they've got. The ideal operator of this business would be a not for profit company or a nonprofit. ",

            "selftext": "**tl;dr: the emome**\n\nPeople need non-verbal clues when talking.  Emojis are goofy and limiting, saying haha or shrug feels weak.\n\nThe answer is to encapsulate what we want to show in `[]` brackets, in a simple brief description.  The brackets help tell machines and people that those words are to be read as non-verbal context.  It tells the speaker it's OK to have a non-verbal clue.  And it avoids confusion about meaning, such as sarcasm [unironically].\n\nIt can be whatever you want, and we will make up the language and change it as we go.\n\ne.g. \n\n[get it?] = I'm expectantly looking to see if you see the value of what I'm saying\n\n[Mad but amused]\n\n[kface] = that blankish look millennials give to show that they are not overly enthusiastic about anything\n\nAnd classics like [wtf?] [Ha] or [s]\n\n\n**Details:**\n\nA process and syntax for communicating digitally, non-verbally:\n\nWe humans are trying to find how to express ourselves - our facial expressions, our aura, our tone of voice - in little digital codes, text. \u00a0We don't seem to have found a good solution yet, emojis don't satisfy.\n\nI suggest a different approach to the problem of expressing non verbal meaning in text messages. \n\nThis method allows a person to express in text their meaning, in a free, true way - not bound to a narrow palate. \u00a0\n\nIt allows us collectively to form an emotional text language that by virtue of being formed in real communication, as language is, is a more true dictionary of people's non-verbal expressions.\n\nUltimately, the dictionary that is formed in this language will provide a valuable educational and technological resource - in social science, for example, or in training AI.\n\n\nI'll call it an **emome.**\n\nHere is what I have so far, for a basic framework of the syntax:\n\n`[a plaintext description of your expression]`\n\nSo, for example\n\n`[embarrassed shrug]`\n`[kinda mad]`\n`[Sarcastic Smirk]`\n`[Self-conscious like there's something on my face]`\n`[possibly serious]`\n`[tired:eyesCslouching]`\n`[shrilly]`\n`[KGARFH]`\n\nHere is what it looks like typed into this Reddit post. [Eyes scanning for reaction]\n\n\n\nSquare brackets frame the emome.\n\nInside the brackets allow all the usual keyboard characters, with the exception of the first character where `\\` is reserved.\n\n`[]` specifically declares no expression. \u00a0It can be used as a prompt or a question, as in `[]?`\n\n\nThere will need to be a character limit - say 56.\n\nTo allow that markup be applied for special readers, there is a space for code at the beginning of the emome after the first bracket, where the normal text can be escaped with a `\\` character, followed by some code and terminated with `\\;` at which point the text content begins.\n\nIt is expected that users will shorten phrases, or create images with the characters, as they settle collectively on the emomes worth remembering.  There should be no restraint other than that the emome conveys in text what would normally be non-verbal communication. \n[conclusive nod]\n",

It doesn't even have to be worldly problems. Like ways to increase efficiency on current technology.\n\nHere's an example I saw:\n\nMillion dollar sensors on something as \"primitive\" (not truly of course) as a tractor to compensate for humans, but instead, a robot on 1 x-axis rail and 2 y-axis rails to constantly monitor each plants needs in a 40x40 grid, and all it would need is a solar panel. Basically like a giant H\n\nHere's one I have thought of:\n\nSeal an electric motor with helium (not hydrogen or you would have a bomb), have an aerodynamic shape, hood scoop, and outside the vehicle (like a sunken supercharger) to air cool while not affecting the vehicle's aerodynamics. Higher efficiency on motor because less air resistance, staying cool, and less effort (most have fans) for cooling.\n\nWe have to think of ways to improve. Now this doesn't mean you should tell us your ideas that you want to patent. This is a thread for all ideas (just like the sub).

Why not have an arcade with a series of small rooms with rotating treadmills that move your character as you do along with a light gun or VR gloves/shoes available at the door in several sizes with dynamic surround sound and lights that sync with the game, maybe ad fans for some ambiance or shaking floors for explosion shockwaves. \n\nRent the rooms out for a certain amount of time, or levels, maybe have memberships and tournaments for players to compete against each other on teams or solo in ultra-realistic online arenas.

It doesn't even have to be worldly problems. Like ways to increase efficiency on current technology.\n\nHere's an example I saw:\n\nMillion dollar sensors on something as \"primitive\" (not truly of course) as a tractor to compensate for humans, but instead, a robot on 1 x-axis rail and 2 y-axis rails to constantly monitor each plants needs in a 40x40 grid, and all it would need is a solar panel. Basically like a giant H\n\nHere's one I have thought of:\n\nSeal an electric motor with helium (not hydrogen or you would have a bomb), have an aerodynamic shape, hood scoop, and outside the vehicle (like a sunken supercharger) to air cool while not affecting the vehicle's aerodynamics. Higher efficiency on motor because less air resistance, staying cool, and less effort (most have fans) for cooling.\n\nWe have to think of ways to improve. Now this doesn't mean you should tell us your ideas that you want to patent. This is a thread for all ideas (just like the sub). We can do this for people who have the means to create these ideas to see.",

Every news article has one week voting period. During this period, every user can give his OWN opinion about every news article \u2013 to vote whether it\u2019s FAKE or TRUE. If the article is gaining most of the TRUE votes, it is labeled by the platform as True News. Otherwise, the news will be judged.\n\nThe Court held during the period week(this period can be longer or shorter in a case of the situation) with the result that the news will be sentenced. Participants in the Court process are a judge, prosecutor, lawyer and 12 jurors from randomly selected users of the platform. Judges and prosecutors will be invited from retired judges and prosecutors.\n \nBased on the verdict made, a precedent will be drawn up according to which news of this type will be marked in the future.",

Imagine a sci-fi universe like star wars or a fantasy universe like Lord of the Rings or any other story imaginable created by us.\n\n\n\nHOW TO:\n\n1) Creation of a new subreddit for this cause\n\n2) An official post by mods every one hour in order to be decided the next word(best comment). The comments will be proposals ONLY in the form of {punctuation mark- word}, {word} or {word- punctuation mark.}, or functions like {*finish title*, *finish chapter* etc}.\n\n3) In te rest of the posts we will discuss the story so far and the ideas for how to continue.\n\n\nI can't do it myself, so im asking you to do it, if you have better ideas on how to implement it please change my plan. Also adjust the writing speed if you think that you have to, my plan is 24 words per day or 168/week so we can discuss the plot as the story continues (like in a hypothetical discussion should a character get angry or speak calmly etc.)",

The series would simply be entitled \"Dreams\" and have a website or subreddit for submissions with the best ones being selected for animation.\n\nMy idea came into fruition after my friend and I decided to start recording our dreams in journals since we have them nearly every night. We have enough to fill up a full season of episodes. If any talented animators are interested in this idea, please PM me.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/dDoKrsj.png",

Create a subreddit that gets pinned to r/all and each week has a random poll created by the Mods of the subreddit. Or better yet, users can create a poll question and submit it and the mods choose a random one.\n\nEach week there is a new poll question that gets selected and the poll question is up the entire week and the results get posted at the last day of the week. \n\nI think this would be cool because as a whole we can see what the majority of reddit likes, wants, thinks or feels. From favorite color, to controversial topics. It would be a great way to have all different subreddits come together and see reddits majority opinion. \n\nThis is just an idea, there are tons of problems like bots that could cause problems so maybe have a small karma requirement.

Term deposits are alright but the return isn't much?\n\nIntroducing.. suicide saver! The idea is that you set a savings goal, say $1000 and a weekly deposit amount, say $100. If you miss ANY payment (here's the suicide bit), even if you've already managed to get to $900 and it's the last payment, you LOSE IT ALL. If you DO manage to hit the savings goal, you get all of your money PLUS a % of all the pooled up money from people who missed their goals. So if someone loses $250 because they missed a payment, that gets split between everyone who successfully manages to hit their savings goals. Naturally as you get closer to your total goal, the pressure builds to make your payment because you've got more to lose if you miss it!\n\n",

            "selftext": "So as the title suggests I have an idea for a fantasy based game where the premise of the game, is not so much about adventure as it is about community.\n\nThe basic idea is that the game would be a fantasy type game where players create live in a realistic fantasy comminity. Some players can create their own cities, within those cities other players can create their own towns and shops run by themselves/other players, others can do quests set by players, etc.\nThe game would be similar to World of Warcraft, but instead of npc's and everybody being an adventurer, players would get to create the world themselves and choose what life they wish to choose. For example, one individual can claim land to create their own small village. From there other players can purchase land from the mayor and create their own little shop/home (bakery, armory, inn, adventure guild, etc...). The mayor could have to pay upkeep to keep his land which he can get from taxes from the citizens, and have to hire services like police to keep the village safe. Many of these types of village can be created and a large economy would be created by the player base, where countless villages trade with one another, and sell to passing adventures. Kingdoms could be formed, wars can be raged. And the game would be as if you were truly playing a real living game rather than a simple scripted story.\n\nStrangely enough, I got idea of this game idea from the old Minecraft server plugin called 'Towny.' I remembered back when I played the game, I joined an extremely small town, bought a plot of land for a house, a farm, and a shop. And I remembered the joy I had watching the town grow as more members joined, and all of the members formed a small but close community.\n\nI also got the idea from an anime called 'konosuba' and 'Sword Art Online' ( <-- even though this sucked, the concept is still amazing). Where people are dropped into a fantasy world, and they are surrounded by other players who essentially formed their own town where each have their own role.\nI'm not too sure how to create this game, as I feel that the game would need to be quite large in order for it to feel fun. You would need a large world with enough land to support the players, A large community to make the game feel alive (as everything would be run by players.) Plenty of job (including adventurers which in itself large) variety to make a functioning world A well balanced economy\n\nI am not too sure how well I explained this idea, but I think that this concept is really interesting, but have not really seen any game actually do this.\n\nIf anybody has any ideas, questions, thoughts ,or anything else please tell me and I will try to answer as soon as possible!\n\n*Note: I made this post in /r/gameideas subreddit half a year ago and got a few comments for a week, but its been dead since, I wanted to see if anyone else still would have an interest in this. Here is the previous post that had some good comments and clarification questions https://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/53az4z/fantasy_community_game/",

For instance when you sell a patent you earn 4 times its current profit so it might make sense to sell at certain times. \n\nAlso it might make sense to buy a cheap negative earning patent as it might turn positive at any time. \n\nSo far I've showed it to some friends and it seemed to keep them entertained. \n\nThis is very experimental, don't really know if it works as a fun game or not.

Charge all PRO adblock users a fixed price say $40/year.  Then divvy up all the sites they see in a month and equally distribute say $20 amongst them keeping $20 for profit.  You never want the user to get stuck in a mentality of surfing less because it costs them, it's more about paying $X a month for all you can eat ad free surfing then distribute the money to the most used websites.",

            "selftext": "Somehow there is a big paradox surrounding us everyday. The number of people per area is in a lot of regions higher than ever, though I feel like there is also more loneliness than ever.\nAt the same time, one is often surrounded by a lot of people, nevertheless there is nearly no communication taking place.\nI was thinking of a way, how to solve this \u201cproblem\u201d.\nThere is this idea of Dunbar\u2019s Number, saying that humans only have a limit to the number of social relationships, so connecting everyone with everyone so everyone becomes friends is probably impossible. \n\nBut how about short-time conversations/interactions with strangers. The chances are pretty high, that someone near to you has some similar interests. \nAt that point I got inspired by Reddit and the Reddit Community, because I find it astonishing, how people can come together over a common topic.\nI am thinking of an app, that allows you to join \u201cgroups\u201d, and will show you all the people in a chosen radius around you, with whom you are in same groups. The idea is then, that you can meet for the timeframe, in which both of you have time, to have a conversation about your common topic.\n\nThis app could be primarily used in moments, where someone is fixed at some place, like sitting in train or waiting at a train station or an airport. But I also got this vision, that such an app could change the way a society communicates in a profound way. Similar to Reddit, the \u201cgroups\u201d would not need to be just \u201cnormal\u201d topics, like \u201csoccer\u201d,\u201dhip-hop\u201d or \u201cphysics\u201d. I can imagine thousands of ways, how people could use such an app to find people with common issues, aims and interests.  For example \u201chow to behave less aggressive\u201d, \u201cintergenerational exchange\u201d, \u201crandom everyday-life stories\u201d and and and\u2026\n\nThe two major problems, which I see in such an app is:\n\n1. the need of high number of users in an area\n2. do people even want to just chat with random strangers.\nBut I feel like those problems shouldn\u2019t stop me from trying it.\n\nI would love to hear some personal opinions on such an app.\n",

            "selftext": "This is an idea that I was pursuing seriously, until I came to the realization that I was simply not up to the task. At one point I required someone to sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement to do some contract work. I\u2019m putting all my intellectual property on the table now in hopes that someone will make this happen. I believe it\u2019s a good idea and much needed in the world, and if you do pursue it, at least in the way I\u2019ve planned out, it will take up all your time.\n\nThis project is most easily comparable to Wikipedia, though it has some fundamental differences. It\u2019s content would consist of any information pertaining to the ethical implications of products and companies. Ideally, its scope would eventually encompass every existing product and company, but in the beginning it would make sense to cover those companies that everyone is most familiar with. A lot of this material is highly controversial and arguably subjective. The aim is cover anything that would be of ethical importance to anyone. It is very important that this project not take the role of any social or political stance, but rather stay as neutral and professional as possible, covering all subjects as objectively so as to uphold credibility.\n\nThe interface would roughly mirror the format of Wikipedia, though it should be more simple and user-friendly. Each product and company would have it\u2019s own page and link to any related products, parent companies or subsidiaries. Each item (company/product) page would generally be in small paragraph or bullet format at first glance with different category headers, such as Politics, Environment, Workers Relations, Social Issues, etc. Initially the most pertinent information would should up that is simple and easily digestible, but you can click to expand to the most extensive coverage and details. Categories will take much thought and refining to maintain similar structure at least amongst similar product/company types. Also at the top of each item page would be general information, non-controversial, similar to the information boxes that show up on the top right of large Wikipedia pages. Eventually each product could store barcodes and you could bring the page up by scanning the barcodes through mobile app. I believe there are product review apps that already do this.\n\nAll companies and products would be organized and searchable as well as browsable by hierarchical structure of categories. Also you could view the hierarchical structure of conglomerates, parent/subsidiary companies, product lines, etc. This information would also be included in the main info section at the top of each item page. Inevitably, information on a page will become outdated, so every page should have the last edit timestamped.\n\nThe most important element in the implementation of this project, I believe, is that all information is externally sourced. As a single entity undertaking a very controversial and disruptive endeavor, the content provided is prone to mistrust. So much of the subject matter lends itself to heavily biased opinions and fanaticism. It is very important that whoever undertakes this project remains as detached as possible to their own personal politics, and be willing to have this work be about serving the public, even if that might mean giving ammunition to arguments that he or she stands against. Regardless of how well you may execute this task with yourself and everyone who contributes, it is still unreasonable to ask the public to trust you. Also, it is impractical to undertake all the heavy lifting of investigative journalism in order to acquire all relevant content.\n\nGathering content would be done by identifying trustworthy and reliable sources of information; finding out which newspapers, magazines, and journalists are legitimate. This is one of the most important factors that determines the success of this project or lack thereof. If you start gathering information from Breitbart, Occupy Democrats, or god forbid Buzzfeed, you have already failed. This part of the project involves some very tricky judgement calls, and this is actually where I hit a wall, as I am very unfamiliar with the world of journalism and different news sources. You will want to involve people where this area is their speciality\u2014people who are knowledgable of different news sources and their interpretation amongst different segments of the population. Now is a more difficult time than ever to gain trust across the board.\n\nInteresting reference re: journalism \u2014 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchdog_journalism#.22Detached_watchdog.22\n\nInitially to gather content, I believe it would be wisest to take as much information you can from existing articles and for the companies that everyone knows about. Eventually though, the growth of content would be fueled by the mutually beneficial relationships developed with the right journalists, to the point where the most obscure industrial manufacturers or mom-and-pop shops would be covered. When the site picks up steam, journalists will help the site by providing content, and consequently the site will give exposure to the journalists through traffic it directs. VERY IMPORTANT\u2014all relationships with journalists are off-the-books. They are not affiliated with the project in any official capacity. Articles they publish are separate from the site, but their content is summarized on the site and referenced/linked, just as it is on Wikipedia. This reiterates that you are not asking anyone to trust your content\u2014only to trust your judgement on who you source, which is already pushing it. Also this method will help you with the inevitable slander/libel legal troubles that you will face. In theory you cannot be prosecuted for that which you did not publish yourself.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that you should avoid any kind of rating or approval system within the site. By doing this you are setting yourself up to be the arbiter of what is good or bad. This incites mistrust in two ways. (1) It expresses bias. Rather than simply relaying information you are  saying you know right from wrong and claiming certain values for the project with any stamp of approval or disapproval. People will see this and conclude that \u201cthis is a liberal site,\u201d or \u201cthis is a conservative site,\u201d and be skeptical of any further information that they find. (2) Who\u2019s to say you weren\u2019t paid by a company to give them the stamp of approval, or perhaps paid by their competitors to give them a stamp of disapproval. Your company may be the most honest and uncorrupt company to every tackle product reviews, but the average readers doesn\u2019t know that.\n\nFor labor in gathering content, I believe it can be implemented by recruiting non-paid editors. It should be a closed, but exponentially expanding network. This is the kind of work that plenty of people would be willing to do for free. Someone would only able to edit if they are invited into the network, or perhaps if they apply and are \u201chired\u201d by an existing editor. This would be a self-policing network, where anyone could flag inaccurate information or biased language, which will inevitably happen. What\u2019s important is that this occurrences get addressed quickly to minimize exposure. These inaccuracies would prevented partially by a system of accountability. If I invite someone to become an editor, I am directly responsible for what they do. If they do not behave appropriately, there is some kind of consequence for me, and perhaps even the person who invited me. This aspect would have to be ironed out. It is crucial that editing content should not be open to the public.\n\nStarting from the ground up, enough content should be gathered to keep peoples attention before actually launching or promoting the site. Perhaps target certain audiences with your content to generate some buzz, and expand your content around that subject to keep peoples attention. In the developing stages, this would probably have to be self funded. Eventually once you launch at least a beta site with enough content to catch peoples interest you could launch a Kickstarter to hire professional web developers, consultants, legal advice, offices, you-name-it. A Kickstarter will only get you so far without revenue. That\u2019s when it would make sense try and get support from investors.\n\nEventually, if it seemed appropriate you could generate revenue using the following method, though I think it would be wise to wait a while before doing this. Any company who is happy with their presence on the site could bid to be placed at the top of each category page, or perhaps on the home page of the site. Apart from a process of the bidders proving that they own the companies they are bidding for, there would be strictly no communication with the bidders or anyone affiliated with that company. They would also have absolutely no control over the content on their own page. If anything, the vetting process for content on those pages would be extra rigorous. Unless there are any special circumstances, the placement gets automatically awarded to the highest bidder, perhaps on a daily or weekly basis. These decisions would not be made manually, reinforcing the idea that the project does not hold any conflict of interests. This system is a win-win, as the project gets a source of income, and in theory, the most ethical (subjective of course) companies, as in the companies that are most proud of how they\u2019re represented, get to have exposure, and we get to feature the (subjectively) \u201cbest\u201d companies, automatically.\n\nAs far as the summary and nuts-and-bolts of this project, that\u2019s everything I can think of right now. This idea was inspired by the fact that simply being a consumer affects the world around you. Referencing my own personal values, if I eat meat that was factory farmed (which is most meat,) I am helping perpetuate the torturous living conditions of sentient beings. By buying most modern electronics, I am contributing to the misery of workers in the third world. We know these things, but we generally don\u2019t have enough concrete information to guide or decisions on what or what not to buy. Even if we are properly informed, sometimes there are simply no options that leave you with a clean conscience. Partially the goal of this project is to bring more awareness to this subject, and to have ethics be a significant element of competition in the marketplace, and something that is subject to verification\u2014simply claiming to be eco-friendly doesn\u2019t make you eco friendly. There are plenty of people who want this, but as consumers we are fairly disempowered by the lack of transparency, as well as our own complacency. This is something that I hope will change that.\n\nBelow is a link to the research and brainstorming that i\u2019ve done with the project so far. Everything in this post and in the G Drive link here is yours! I really hope this is something that gets built. I\u2019m hoping people will comment and challenge some of the ideas and methods of implementation here. I\u2019m not an expert on everything that i\u2019ve written\u2014simply doing my best with the knowledge that I have. You\u2019re more than welcome to PM me with any specific questions as well.\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B4rvb8KQruBST0s0RU8zVk5RdlE?usp=sharing\n\nTLDR: Database for ethical implications of buying different products.

            "selftext": "I'd like to see some company like Google create an AI that followed a student through their lives and assisted with learning. Every year students tend to get new teachers and therein lies a fixable issue. New teachers need to get to know a student and how they best process incoming information. Perhaps a kid has a strong passion for sports but has trouble with certain aspects of math. An AI could identify the interest and problem and help create education content that brought math into the realm of interest (ex. figuring out an athletes chances of scoring a goal, or running averages)\n\nI've seen the beginnings of this idea on websites like KhanAcademy where areas of difficulty are highlighted, but there's a lack of 'follow through' in this regard. A personal and tailored AI could be a boon for our next generations of learners. ",

When the pen breaks the laser field the camera sees that and creates the digital representation.\n\nDifficulties:\nIt would take some testing to get the laser/camera positioned to where your fingers don't break the beam or block the camera.\nWould other products like a LiveScribe be more useful although more expensive.\n",

The major problems I see just off the bat are: liscenese plates getting photographed and people getting into legal trouble, the idea actually catching on and obtaining users, and finally the photo recognition software or verification process used to \"spot\" a car.

These RFID stickers are super cheap a dollar or less per.\n\nThrough an app you can take a picture of each piece of clothes and associate it with that RFID tag, then hang them in your closet. At this point the system can manage where all your clothes are, if it leaves the closet or drawer without putting it back it will know you're wearing that outfit. This way it can tell you what clothes are clean and dirty by checking via the app what clothes are available in the closet. It can give you alerts on when to do laundry when you're running low.\n\nAlso, through machine learning it can remember what clothes you've previously worn together and give you recommendations based on what you have available that's clean.",

            "selftext": "**The Premise:**  \nLots of tools online already advertise properties for sale, providing details about beds/baths/sq. footage, etc.  \n  \nBut do any of them take into account the similarity/interests you might have with nearby neighbors?  \n  \n**The Value-Add:**  \nIf I'm looking at three houses around town that are comparable in price and size but one of them is down the block from someone who went to the same college as me and has a wife who loves wine-tastings as much as mine does, I'm going to be more inclined to go take a look at the house for sale down the block from them than the other two houses for sale across town, all things being equal.  \n  \nIt seems the quality of community is not really factored into the real estate business.  \n  \n------ \n  \n  \n**How It Might Work:**  \nThe way I see this platform working is that when neighbors see a house go up for sale on the block, they \"list\" that property on the site (independently of the formal listing the home-sellers have arranged). The neighbors then indicate some of their own interests and the sort of neighbors they're hoping will move in. They have an interest in the next people that move in because it affects the personality of the neighborhood and naturally they want neighbors with whom they can get along and become friends.  \n  \nThis provides a new layer of information to prospective home buyers to help them decide where they might feel most at home. A first step towards meeting likeminded neighbors, whether they're right across the street or several blocks away. What sometimes takes weeks or months exploring the neighborhood can happen much faster when it's deliberate in this way.\n  \nIf the new family moves in and happens to check most of the boxes the neighbors had been hoping they would in terms of tastes, interests, and other similarities, then the neighbors will be glad they advertised the property for sale and are likely to stop by to say hello (and maybe bring over a plate of brownies or a lasagna!)  \n  \nMaybe it seems contrived, but I suppose anything to help revitalize neighborly comraderie is worth considering in our isolated age.",

            "selftext": "Got this idea when I noticed alot of uber and postmates delivery food service people delivering food. But the problem is if you wanted a really good burger from one joint and then an ice cream from another joint, that's considered 2 deliveries. Also many times locals order things that non-locals don't know about, so it would be great to curate some of the best stuff from local restaurants... Think pintrest but for food delivery.\n\nNow the delivery would be piggy backing on top of existing delivery services like uber and postmates. We don't actually deliver the food to people, but we provide a central hub where our own pick up people just go around those restaurants and pick up food and bring it back to the central hub, which gets picked up by the 3rd party service (uber/postmates/caviar/etc...)\n\nThis solves:\n\n- ability to order from multiple places at once\n\n- ability to see curated food from others\n\n- no need to own a restaurant\n\n- no need to do the deliveries to customers\n\nCost:\n\n- rent for central hub\n\n- pay pick up people\n\n- backend service that takes in orders and pushes out orders to these restaurants...\n\n-------\n\nI own a shop in NYC chinatown, if anyone wants to take a gamble at this... lol... \n\njust one of those idea days... \n\nsomeone run with it =)\n\nin essence, its a middle man of a middle man service!",

            "selftext": "Uber connects individuals who have cars and driving ability with individuals who need to be driven. A true \"Uber for food\" would connect individuals who have food and cooking ability to individuals who need to be fed.\n\nCurrently, UberEATS just connects restaurants without delivery infrastructure with people who need to be fed. The food is still coming from a traditional provider at traditional cost. If Uber worked like UberEATS, it would just be a directory of local cab companies that let you call a cab from the app through a uniform interface. That's not how Uber works - Uber is much more elegant than that.\n\nHere's how a true \"Uber for food\" could work:\n\n* Individuals who like to cook can list their dishes on the app, taking photos, like an Airbnb listing.\n\n* Users who like the look of the food order it, and pay Uber.\n\n* The cook prepares the meal and gives it to an Uber delivery guy who's paid by Uber.\n\n* Uber pays the cook a % of the customer's payment, less their delivery cost and profit.\n\n* Customers rate their meal out of 5 stars and also leave a text review, allowing you to crowd source great home cooking from your local area.\n\n* Dishes would only be available while cooks had signed into the app and specifically turned on the dishes they're able/willing to prepare at that time.\n\nAdvantages of this system over traditional restaurants and UberEATS:\n\n* People can make and sell their cooking without all the overhead associated with traditional restaurants, e.g. employees, premises, advertising, etc.\n\n* Customers can get cheaper food that's closer to the price of actual home cooking, since it was produced more cheaply.\n\np.s. This would inevitably lead to a buttlode of health department/hygiene problems, but Uber hasn't exactly been popular with regulators anyway. They'd just make out like their chefs are \"independent contractors\" and are responsible for their own food safety ratings.",

The tattoo thing is just an app that stores the image/soundfile on their servers- which you have to pay for! So why not just have an app that does the same for your own files? \n\nSo it would work like this:\n\n1) Get your tat. \n\n3) Download app\n\n4) Register tat on the database:  take/upload a high quality pic and a link to your sound file. Or heck, to any file that others can read.\n\n5) Show it off\n\nNow granted, this would require a publicly accessible database where people register their tats so that people could scan your tattoo and hear your sounds. \n\nOr you could have various Spotify playlists registered to the images. So you're gonna get some lovin' from your girl? Point your phone at the tat that references them and let it roll!",

            "selftext": "When the weather is nice people like to spend a lot of time in their garden or on their patio and they like to give it some attention to enhance its appearance. There are many ways how you can decorate your home exterior but the best way to do this is with exterior lighting. Outdoor lighting is not only intended to increase your visionary when it gets dark, it is also suitable for accentuating certain spots or for creating a certain ambiance.\nIt can be difficult to decide what it is you think is suitable for your garden or patio. There are so many options to consider that choosing an option can be quite hard. Off course you have to choose between solar lighting and basic low voltage lighting but your choice does not stop there. You could decide to install a basic wall sconce which emits enough light for your entire patio, but you can also choose to accentuate certain areas with lanterns, torches or string lights.\nMost people that want to decorate their home exterior will choose for one strong, bright light fixture and they will add it up with ambiance lighting. In this way you can read a book when you need more light and you can also dim the wall sconce and enjoy your ambiance lighting.\nCreating an ambiance is really not that hard because all you have to do is add a few accent lighting fixtures. Outdoor lanterns are a very good fixture to use if you want to create a nice romantic setting. Most lanterns use candles as their light source and this combination adds a nice light effect on its direct surrounding. If you don't have small children you could also decide to add a few torches on your patio to set the right mood. Torches are able to set the right mood for the evening and besides illuminating the area, they will also emit heat for comfort.\nDecorating your patio or garden with outdoor lighting fixtures is really not that hard and all you need is a bit of creativity to do it. it is important not to install too many lighting fixtures because this will not create a nice ambiance but will rather make a circus out of your garden.\nhttp://www.lightingever.com/outdoor-lighting",

            "selftext": "So I\u2019ve had this idea for an MP3 device for a little while now. I know the MP3 player market is dwindling considerably but I think there still may be a good segment of people who would be interested in a product like the one I have in mind (specifically the fitness market). The idea is fairly simple.\n\n1. The device would be quite small - Think iPod Nano 7th Gen small.\n2. The device would be bluetooth and wifi capable.\n3. The device would have a slot for adding an optional Sim card for data.\n4. If you would opt to add a SIM card and use data the device would allow you to use streaming services like Spotify, Pandora, Apple Music, Tidal, etc. If you don\u2019t want to add data, no sweat. At least you would have the option.\n5. The device would also have a large number of accessories like clips or other attachment paraphernalia that would be available for purchase. Giving the user options for how to use the device would be key.\n6. The device would come in different storage sizes ranging from 16GB up to 100GB.\n7. Depending on the storage size you would choose, retail price would be $75 - $130.\n\nPersonally, I would love something like this. I can take my phone on a run but phones are getting larger and larger and I don\u2019t like having to add an armband or something similar. Most stand alone music players I\u2019ve seen don\u2019t give you the option to use streaming services and the few I\u2019ve see that do are very expensive.  I believe the small form factor, large storage size, option to use streaming services and cost would appeal to a good portion of the fitness crowd.\n\nWhat do you guys think? A good idea or something that would be a disaster? \n",

This will bring the problems to many users instead of the users having to first find the problem, then find a solution.\n\nHere's an example I saw:\n\nMillion dollar sensors on something as \"primitive\" (not truly of course) as a tractor to compensate for humans, but instead, a robot on 1 x-axis rail and 2 y-axis rails to constantly monitor each plants needs in a 40x40 grid, and all it would need is a solar panel. Basically like a giant H\n\nHere's one I have thought of:\n\nElectric motors are efficient, but can be even more so.\n\nSeal an electric motor with helium (not hydrogen or you would have a bomb), have an aerodynamic shape, hood scoop, and outside the vehicle (like a sunken supercharger) to air cool while not affecting the vehicle's aerodynamics hugely. Higher efficiency on motor because less air resistance, staying cool, and less effort (most have fans) for cooling.",

            "selftext": "This was an idea I randomly got while lying in bed last night, I think it would be a cool show, here is the rough idea:\n\n\nIts been a long time since the peak of people serving the greek gods, with people turning away from them, they have slowly died off, there is only one god left, Zeus. He has very little power left, barely enough to live 1 maybe 2 hounded more years. But he is lonely, and does not want the gods to be gone forever, so with his last power, he bestows it upon humanity, and chooses 12 humans to take up the mantel of the 12 greek gods of Olympus. Then he dies. Now these random humans that were picked to be the new gods do not know, and they just suddenly have powers. They need to learn about them ect, once people learn about their powers, maybe some of them are showing of to earn money ect, they get fans. The more fans, or followers they have, the more powerful they become. Eventually some government fight some, but they are too powerful ect. Maybe some are caught.\n\n\nWhat do you guys think, would this be cool or no?",

The reason protests work is because of the disobedience &  disruption.\n\nThe idea is to create some sort of distributed computing software/applet in order to cause unwanted network disruption but interfaced in such a way as to facilitate a protest for a normal computer user.\n\nAny thoughts on this type of protest?\n\n",

Please rip apart!  \n\nIdea 1: Remove the cylinders, rods, heads, crankshaft. Install one small motor per cylinder with a spur/worm/bevel gear meshing on a new geared crankshaft. How shitty would this setup's efficiency be?  \n\nIdea 2: Remove cylinders, heads. Install electromagnetic solenoids connected to the rods, connected to the crank. Run off the distributer.. somehow. Critique?  \n\nAsk away! I'd love to answer any questions I can.. I have ideas..  \n\nRegenerative braking? Some sort of alternator where the torque converter used to be! idk. That's why I'm here.  \n\nTo be clear, I'm not looking to revolutionize EV, I'm looking for a car I can drive every two days that costs me about what my v6@20mpg costs me now. Heck, even if it costs a bit more, that's ok!  \n\nBottom line, it needs to be cheap and green, have great 0-60, and get about 100 miles every two days and eventually be a kit available otc.  \n\nEdit: I would like to run this on readily available lawn batteries. 12v, 250cca, $30ec.

(I would ask people I know, except I would like a reasonably large, unbiased sample of people).\n\nMy idea is just a group chat application which assigns the user into a group of 4 or 5 random people (It will have to start with only people who can speak English, due to the fact that I have absolutely no knowledge of other languages because, well, I'm a programmer) where they can talk about stuff they're interested in/have in common... (At some point, I would make it so that people could be put in groups with similar interests).\nIf people want to then they can leave the group, or, if the vote is unanimous, they can be kicked from the group. In either of these eventualities, they would be put in a new group.\n\nI'm asking here because I couldn't find something like this anywhere on the internet; the closest I could find was something like [Omegle](https://www.reddit.com/r/omegle/), but that is a one on one chat, and the people you talk with changes each time you use it, my hope for my app is that the user would, hopefully, build up some sort of friendship with these people (sort of like that XKCD from the first paragraph, only without the short existential crisis afterwards).",

It's great that we can create a subreddit for every specific interest and group, however, with that also comes a problem of exposure and also low activity in groups that have very specific interests and guidelines.\n\nInstead, if a specific interest of yours could be classified as a special case of one or more general topics, creating a multireddit that filters for only posts that are cross-posted between multiple subreddits would effectively filter out the content that's not interesting to you, leave you only the content you want to see, but leave you included in larger communities from the parent subreddit.

It will have two pairs of tracks, arranged in a square shape (each track is parallel to the other part of the pair). You can switch between the two sets of tracks so you can change direction quickly, or have an immediate spare if one set is destroyed. Both can be used like normal tracks. It will be a big and easy to see target, but that can be compensated with highly increased armor and a special intimidation factor. There's this shade of black that is so dark it looks like a black hole since it absorbs all light; this would be used for paint color, along with red lights (optional) so it looks more evil. This could (and should) be backed up with weaker units, because everyone will be busy attacking this behemoth of a tank. I probably sound like a warmonger or psychopath or something like that with this idea, but it would be of use, right? Maybe?",
