If you're under the impression that it works I'll quickly fill you in and say the only power normal people have nowadays is which group of people they want to screw them over. Call me a dreamer but I think we can do better.\n\nSo why don't we just make a public website to replace government.\nThe way I see it is there would be two main parts to the website:\n\n1) A wikipedia style section where every issue will have its own page, and presented will be a summary of popular opinion backed up by facts, references etc.\n\n2) A discussion section where every issue is discussed in detail by whoever wants to pitch in. Discussion would be ongoing and the wiki page on the issue would be updated as new consensus is reached.\n\nModding, troll-slayers etc would be necessary but I think you can see from reddit it's not too hard to have good debate online.\n\nObviously this website would have no direct power, but I think if you had layed out clearly the closest thing to the collective opinion, i.e. democracy, people would have to take notice. At first maybe just some news outlets would pay attention, russel brand might provide a retweet who knows. But the more people realised that the needs of people can be represented better by something created by said people, than by politicians, the more momentum and respect the site would have.\n\nTo me this seems too good to be true, a way of actually representing collective decision fairly, so please tell me why it is too good to be true and I'll log off reddit and lose myself in gta again.

I'm a horrible person, so I think it's obnoxious hauling all the parts up from the basement and putting the thing together. The branches are individual components that latch on to a central column. To put it away, you have to stack them in a box in a way that still takes up a ton of space. It takes forever to reassemble.\n\nSince the branches can interweave anyway, why not have the central column collapse instead of having to disassemble the whole thing? It could collapse into a squat, cylindrical shape and live in a squat, cylindrical case. It would still be heavy, but possibly less awkward to move and a lot less effort to set up and tear down.\n\nOnly downside is the trunk might be weaker than the alternatives. Would you buy one?\n\nedit: Looks like someone came up with a similar idea decades ago, but with a spiral shape. https://encrypted.google.com/patents/US3677867",

            "selftext": "I have this idea;\nI would like to see a program that actually rewarded people for doing good things. What if we had a system that kept track of someone who volunteers to help an elderly person, or clean up a neighborhood, drives well, mentor a young person...anything that benefits humanity, the environment, things like that. We could call it \"US Life Credit System or something. For example; Everyone who registers will get a swipe card. Card readers will be available at every local volunteer location (via mobile apps). Someone swipes their card at the beginning and end of work. Over time, points are added to your card. Here's the cool part -- as points are added, card holders can receive things like tax breaks, discounts on Drivers License fees, free fishing permits, National and State Park passes, Toll Road fees, extra vacation days, and so much more. Private business could get involved as well, offering discounts for goods and services based on USC scores. I can imagine how many people would be off the couch, if they new that they could be looking at a significant discount on their taxes, just by doing the right thing. How much would it cost? Not as much as you might think -- if this concept caught on, cost for running this program could be significantly offset by being able to reduce other Federal, State and Local programs, because an army of volunteers have created a much more efficient, personalized method to feed the hungry, house the homeless, and care for our lands. You know, I'm just an Engineer, but it seems to me if we actually SHOWED our appreciation to those who would choose to live in harmony with each other and our environment, to do good things everyday, a program like this would make perfect sense. We're quick to slam anyone caught doing something wrong. I'd like to emphasize the value of doing something good. I would like to bring real reward to those to take the high ground, and represent the very best that is America. How can you help? Give me an open mind, and imagine the possibilities of a program like this. If you like it, then spread the word. \"Money\", by itself, isn't a bad thing. How we pursue, and how we value it above all things, is the value that must change. Perhaps if money could be derived from simply doing good things, then doing good things would be simple.

This way ad revenue is continually redistributed until users pool NanoPatrons at one point in response to quality content and can be turned back into real money in the content creators' pockets.\n\nThis way ad money is distributed, not by how riddled with ads a piece of content is, but by how much the content is loved by its consumers. And the best thing? No reliance on \"[whales](http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/195806/chasing_the_whale_examining_the_.php)\", the money isn't all coming into the system from a small percentage of wealthy power users, every active user gets some NanoPatrons to contribute to the creator they care about.\n\nThough that's not to say the system couldn't allow power users to buy NanoPatrons directly so they can fund the creators they love as much as they want.\n\nBut the aim here is to bridge the gap between the old trusty ad revenue model so common to the internet and the upstart patronage revenue model that's bringing a second age of content creation to the internet.\n\nHow do you think it looks? Could it achieve its aim? Anything need explaining further?\n\nI came up with this listening to stuff you should know podcast's kickstarter episode when they called it micro patronage and I wonder what nano patronage would be and the above is what I came up with.\n\nWhat do you think nano patronage would look like? Is this system a good way to do it?\n\nThis could be used on any site that puts ads on user-generated content, reddit, youtube, facebook, etc.\n\nIf you have a website that could fit with this model feel free to use it, no attribution required.",

By being placed on this planet it would signify the presence of intelligent life, and would become their 'home world' (to name what they liked) and would then be visible to other players.  \nAs you zoomed around the galaxies you may come across another persons home world. You could mark to say you had discovered it, giving details of how far away your planets were from each other and other such facts, and possibly (with enough data), beginning to show the improbability of discovering intelligent life (assuming faster than light travel can't exist).  \nIt would be pretty darned cool, I'm sure there are other crazy add-ons to this crazy idea that one could think of...  \n\n\u00a0\n\n...

He survives the crash and wakes up in a bed, where local chinese have taken care of him. He realizes that is located in a remote village cut off from the World where people have no idea that there is a war going on and that Chinese and Japanese are rivals. Instead they are only taking care of their normal life, harvesting, and living their lives. As time goes one, he starts to realize how meaningless wars are, how we all humans should think for ourselves what are we doing in going out there and killing other humans. Over the story he will manage to make the audio transmitter in his plane to work but it will just be able to receive transmissions. Over time, he will no longer desire to listen to what is going on outside, and will carry his life over that village.  Images of the past will also occur during the story.  \n\n\nSo this is it.

            "selftext": "Given the amount of propaganda from news sources and emphasis on voting without necessarily informing oneself (Rock the Vote), I thought it'd be useful to have a resource where the politics of all candidates for any race are laid out in a neutral and obvious way. Also, by putting all the info in one place, users can inform themselves better about local elections that would otherwise go unnoticed due to lack of screen time. \n\nThe topmost information on a page would be more like a candidate baseball card with photo and quick list of major stances on issues. The rest of it would detail things like prior office experiences, major legislation passed, history of voting, maybe some cool graphics on liberal or conservative leanings and or times flip flopped on issues. Most importantly though, there would be no discussion of character or personal life that might cause unnecessary bias. \n\nAlso, users can search elections/candidates by state and city/town, by year, by party, by incumbent or challengers, by office, etc. \n\nAlso, this would ultimately work like a wiki, so this is a not-for-profit crowdsourced effort. Given the success of Wikipedia and the like, we could see very balanced and successful results for high profile elections while it may stay rough around the edges for local elections, but like Wikipedia, I imagine something like this would only succeed and be accepted given enough time. We could potentially work this into a Wikimedia proposal. \n\nWould love to hear feedback on the feasibility of this idea and execution. \n\nEDIT: removed quotes around new sources to sound less bitter",

            "selftext": "Here I am at the shopping centre with 40 minutes to kill. My first thought is \"Catch a movie!\" \n\nBut there aren't any movies showing that are less than 90 minutes long. \n\nI guess this is more of a 'why is it not a thing' post than anything else. The idea seems obvious. Short films are being made all the time, aren't they? Charge moviegoers 5-10 bucks (based off the normal price for a full-length movie being 15-20 in Australia) for a 30-40 minute movie. Reel in the people like me who are waiting to pick someone up and got their shopping done early, and workers on lunch breaks, etc. \n\nIt'd be a good way to showcase indie films, too.\n\nPossible cons:\n\n- A movie that's 30% long doesn't necessarily cost 30% of the price. It might not be worth making/licensing such a short film for commercial viability. \n\n- If you've got the time and the equipment, why not just show a AAA movie that you know will sell tickets? My response to this would be that maybe you can have smaller theatres for the short films, too. Especially if it's an indie film - they probably don't shoot in such a high resolution as to be viewable on a large screen. So you could show two short films in the physical space of one, and 6-8 short films in the *time* of one longer film.\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: I am not a cinema buff, and know next to nothing about the economics of movie production and presentation. The same goes for absolutely everything about indie films. But hey, at least I'd watch them if they showed in the local cinema. ",

(That conversation is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/2nxshe/are_college_educated_police_safer_officers_with/).)\n\nSo it occurred to me that one way to address the problem we have in this country with police would be to encourage police to attend college and get a bachelor's before going to the academy by offering loan repayment and maybe even a salary boost.\n\nThat obviously isn't an entire solution, but as a small part of a larger solution it seems like something everyone could support. Why would a politician, liberal or conservative, oppose funding a program to repay loans for college graduates who want to become police officers?\n\nI think that would be a great start and make other important reforms easier.\n\nAs much as police in this country drive me nuts by the outrageous behavior of what I will charitably assume is a small minority of cops, along with the complicity most of the rest of them, I think the solution is not to attack the profession of law enforcement but to elevate it.",

            "selftext": "What if the government was willing to create futures contracts on whether a certain individual would commit a violent crime?\n\nWhat I mean is - you could buy crime prevention future against a block of say 1000 people when they are born. If they **don't** commit a violent crime, the government pays you a certain amount annually. If they **do** commit a violent crime, you have to pay a certain large amount to cover the cost to society. The rates of the payments could be set based on the current risk level for those kids to commit a crime. Then the investors would have an incentive to do whatever will help prevent those kids from committing crime later in life.\n\nHere's the background: I was reading this article about how lead causes violent crime (http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2013/01/lead-crime-link-gasoline). On the second page, he shows an economic analysis of the returns for investing in removing lead paint from children's environments. My first thought was that I would totally invest cash in that if there were any way to claim those kind of returns. And then my thought is - why isn't there a way to do that?\n\nWe could work really hard to pass initiatives to do all sorts of things to prevent crime (like remove lead paint from kid's houses or provide preschool or whatever). But if we passed something like what I'm suggesting, then there would be an incentive to try any new idea that has economic basis.\n\nHere's what I'm imagining could happen - investors enter into a \"crime futures\" contract with the government (could be state or federal) for blocks of 1000 kids or something (or maybe entire neighborhoods). Then they do as much as they can economically justify to help make sure those kids don't commit crime. Then when those kids **don't** commit crime, they earn their investment back as payments from the government. Or in fact, the entire contract could be securitized and tradeable. So once the kids start to grow up, you could show the improvement and resell the contract to someone else because it's clear that it will pay off in the future. In any case, it's a win-win - society gets less crime and investors can earn a return on the investment of money it costs to make it happen.\n\nAm I crazy?",

If they were also put to work laying down fiber cables and other internet infrastructure that the government can then rent out for profit to local areas (or companies or sell it at premium). \n\nAnother thing is that this could provide jobs to inmates with good behavior, that way, once they are released from prison  they would be the perfect candidate to maintain a local presence and do maintenance on the lines. A stable well paying medium income job so they would be less inclined to turn back to crime. Better yet, if they DO turn back to crime considering how much such a job would make there would very likely be inmates lined up in prison waiting for the opportunity. \n\nIs internet infrastructure too complicated though? Thoughts? \n\nEDIT: Adding this due to feedback.\n\nThere would be a certain kind of zoning laws prohibiting government interaction in areas with a certain level of internet quality. It would also prohibit them from building so long as a company has proof of plans in the works to build or upgrade within a set time. (Like a year) This would create the much needed competition that only google fiber seems to provide currently and would also increase infrastructure. \n\nRegardless of how internet companies reacted, it would create faster internet speeds, more jobs, and less repeat offenders.

            "selftext": "Of the many services that a municipal government provides for its community, the police force is one of the most visible and crucial.\n\nAnd yet, there is a serious disconnect in the orientation of the police departments in the community. It's odd that although the police serve and protect the community, the community has almost no visibility into or control over its operation. Rather, management and funding decisions are controlled by the mayor and city council, which is a small and often elite group with experiences and interests that may differ quite seriously from those of the community.\n\nThe apparent purpose of this structure is to insulate the police department from public review and input. The public has no meaningful way to express its collective opinion, and no trustworthy mechanism for having its complaints taken seriously. Collection of actual metrics is scant - e.g., the surprising unavailability and unreliability of police fatalities - but even improved metrics cannot capture more important factors. Are the police responsive, or derelict? Thorough, or dismissive? Reasonably forceful, or brutal? Respectful, or thuggish? Community-focused, or detached? These criteria strongly affect their effectiveness, but are difficult to evaluate from routine statistics.\n\nThe overt results of this lack of public input are protests and riots. The less visible result is an endemic, deep-rooted public mistrust and hostility toward police. This setting exacerbates every interaction; increases hostility toward police, and cops' self-perception as potential targets; and discourages people from calling the police when needed.\n\nThe infrastructure of our nation is steadily moving toward a system of federal evaluation: review systems are in progress for teaching and healthcare. It's time for a similar system for police - both to identify areas of urgent problems, and to highlight police communities that serve their communities well.\n\n**Step 1: Data Collection and Reporting**\n\nA mechanism should be implemented to poll the public about the effectiveness of the police force. This could be a simple letter grade or 1-to-10 scale - \"how do you rate the police for your community?\" - or a questionnaire.\n\nSome considerations:\n\n* Standardization - avoiding the crafting of questions to highlight strong areas of the police force, and to minimize weak areas.\n\n* Reliability - resistance to tampering, both by respondents and collectors.\n\n* Availability - the data can't be subject to publication if positive or burial if negative; it should be broadly available for every community in the nation.\n\n* Anonymity - preventing retaliation.\n\nOne such system would involve a federally mandated set of poll questions to be added to every local election ballot, collected by the FEC, and reported as a public federal database.\n\nThe benefits of such a system, simply for collecting and reporting this data, are easy to identify:\n\n* Provides a centralized, disinterested source of information - the public can rely on their opinions being accurately tallied.\n\n* Enables and informs research such as comparisons among communities and regions; emerging trends; and the effectiveness of various programs, such as the use of body cameras.\n\n* Identifies communities with problematic police forces, and forces them to address the most pressing concerns of the community that feed into those metrics.\n\n* Applies positive competitive pressure among communities to improve the quality of their police forces.\n\n* Utilizes existing infrastructure in a way that is already resistant to tampering, and that tightly binds the opinions about police forces to the local community that most frequently encounters it.\n\n**Step 2: Use of Data**\n\nWhile simply collecting and reporting this data provides many advantages, this data could be further leveraged to address many problems with the police community. For example, federal resources could be made available for reforming police forces. As two examples:\n\n* Local federal funding could also be tied to the ratings of police forces, with funding cuts for municipalities that are unresponsive to low community ratings.\n\n* The federal government could provide task forces that can visit the lowest-performing police communities, conduct an internal review, and recommend changes.\n\n",

The motherboard, USB, audio ports, everything.\n\nSure, it will be thicker and this probably won't work for high end models meant for gaming or development, but for your average core i5, 4GB RAM work computer, I think we can stuff it all into the monitor. The CPU chassis as well as the monitor have quite a lot of empty space, mostly for design purposes I guess.

Start small with someone we can agree to with a plurality or majority, then contribute to their campaign until they win.  All we have to do is outspend their opponent(s) and we have an increased chance of winning according to this article:\n\nhttp://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2014/04/04/think-money-doesnt-matter-in-elections-this-chart-says-youre-wrong/\n\nI know the article is discussing congressional races with incumbents, but I think it also demonstrates the influence of money, just in case we were wondering about that.\n\nIf we can get somebody elected as mayor, we can elect District Attorneys, Governors, Presidents, maybe?  \n\nOn the other hand, we could get behind opposing somebody who we all agree should NOT be elected.  Then we would again just outspend on their opponent.\n\nThis idea (even to me) sounds manipulative, contrary to the ideas of the founding fathers, and borderline illegal.  But these are the tactics that some organizations and individuals are already using against the will of the majority. \n\nThis would become a subreddit called something like /r/buytheelectionwithsparechange\n\nPlease come and tell me why this can't work.  :)\n\n",

            "selftext": "Hello Reddit.  This is my very first post.  I've been browsing reddit technology and futurology for some time now, but I haven't posted anything until now.  The reason I'm posting now is to hopefully brain storm with some of you about an idea I have. I think it's a really good idea, but I don't know how to go about developing and actualizing it.\n\nMy name is Drew. I'm 27.\n\nI live a fairly comfortable life as a United States citizen.  I have a place to live, a car, a job, and plenty of food.\n\nI like many people really like to help others and share of my abundance when I can. There is a great deal of satisfaction that comes from knowing you've made a difference in someone else's life. Giving freely promotes a positive and powerful environment which allows for trust, barrier breaking and emotional connection.  It's nice to feel like somebody's hero.\n\nAs human beings, we like to give. We like helping other people. We just like to be able to do it on our own terms.\n\nThere are over 7 billion people alive today, and nearly half of them live in poverty.  \n\nI believe that if you live here on this planet then you're worthy of love.  I would like to be able help all 7 billion of you individually and on a personal level... But I'm only one person. I get tired. I'll admit it, I get grumpy and selfish. I've been known on rare occasions to be outright rude...\n\nThere are many noble charities across the globe who tirelessly work to help those in need.  I assume that for the most part, they are run by good, non-corrupt people.  We often give to certain charities out of a feeling of guilt or a desire to help, but when you can't see where your money goes, and you don't see or know the people you're donating to, you don't really get that same good feeling of helping your fellow man.\n\nSo what's the point? We all want the world to be a better place, but what can we really do on our own as individuals?\n\nWell what if you could make a difference in someone's life for as little as no effort, and then actually see how your charity changed the world for the better?\n\nPicture this.\n\nIt's a website like Kickstarter or Indie Go-go, but it's just for normal people who need help.  Interested parties would register with the site which would act as a platform for them to upload a video explaining their need, and their plan to achieve their goal.  Next, the world responds by donating money and/or effort toward the cause.  When the person or group in need has had their need met, they would then upload another video showing how the donation was used.\n\nMy hope is that as more and more people's needs are met by the site, a community like reddit would form. \n\nImagine if it got really big.  What if a system was set up so that registered volunteers and donors could get, \"points,\" or \"credits,\" for helping people?  What if you could eventually exchange these credits for goods and services?  A currency backed by labor and charitable donations.  Could this be the answer to global wealth redistribution?\n\nSo yeah that's my idea.  I've been calling it, \"the big idea.\" Really hoping I get some good feedback and/or people who are interested in helping me get this thing started.  I've talked to my friends and family about it a little, but haven't really gotten any solid advice yet about where to start. \n\n**If you're still reading, thank you so much for checking out my first Reddit post.  If you have any pointers about my post (i.e. \"TLDR,\" or \"wrong subreddit.\" or \"why you can't grammar?\"), I'm very open to suggestion, and I welcome your constructive criticism. ",

I just don't need to put myself under unnecessary stress. There are a lot of people in my situation around the world, and everybody has at least moments where they need a break. \n\nBecause of this, I think a tv or web channel exclusively designed to give you content of any type designed to make you feel only positive emotions, whether it's excitement, fun, peaceful contentment, etc... would have a great niche and lots of casual viewers. It'd be nice to have a tv channel where you're guaranteed to find something uplifting or lighthearted instead of having to navigate between drama, Very Special Episodes, last minute news, etc...\n\nThe content could be diverse: From cars to fashion or cats, to a good-news-only news, as well as positive music videos, cooking, and so on. It's relatively easy to find or create uplifting music playlists on Spotify or other services, it should be as easy to find content/a channel based on the criteria of desired emtions (in this case, positive ones).",

            "selftext": "This is actually my first Reddit post. Been gleaning from the vast amounts of knowledge, and entertaining content on here for a few weeks now, and I hope this post makes a contribution. \n\nI have been thinking about what makes Christmas a \"magical time of year\" a lot lately, especially having kids and wanting to make it special for them too. This has required a lot of reminiscing about Christmas' past, and those from my childhood, when times were simple, and I didn't bear the weight of the world as I do now. \n\nNow, I feel I need to add a small (hopefully) amount of background here: I was married at 21, dead broke, but in love. Due to a number of circumstances and choices I won't get into here, my wife and I found ourselves in financial disaster after 4 months of being married: both unemployed, homeless, no real supporting family, and pregnant with our first child. \nI am now 27, and we have two children. I have spent the last 6 years working tirelessly in many different jobs to try and dig out of the bottomless chasm that we were helplessly flung into, and even now, we are barley making it. We're in the best place we've ever been (financially speaking) but still barely making it and no cushion to speak of. \nSo now here we are. A struggling family of four, who is trying to find any way possible of affording Christmas presents for our kids. Trying to remember what made Christmas time magic, and striving to provide that for our little ones. \nAfter thinking about it for a while I realized that what makes it all \"magical\" is HOPE.  A very real hope. Hope that somehow, come Christmas morning, your life will be made better than it is today; that somehow, the payoff of your \"labor\" will come to fruition. Or a hope that what you will get the very thing you have been wanting and waiting for, for so long. THAT'S what I remembered made Christmas such a great time of year. All that hope. \n\nSo, what if you had the means or funds to give to a family that has been working hard, fighting the tide, a chance to not only get back their feet, but a real chance at a future? \nI was thinking about the biggest challenge to my little family really \"making it\" back on our feet, and it all came down to housing. It's FREAKING expensive to have a place large enough to fit my whole family. I mean\u2026 it's ridiculous. The place we live in is a dump\u2026 I mean, generously. But it's the only place we could afford that was within commuting distance of my job. So, what would I like for Christmas? A new, safe, healthy home for my family that doesn't cost a fortune! That's my wish\u2026\n\nSo here's the big idea: WHAT IF people started (anonymously or otherwise) \"sponsoring\" families/singles/couples that have gone through hard times with ONE YEAR PAID RENT in a new home of their choice (up to a certain amount)???  Obviously there are a TON of details to be worked out with something like this (what's the cap? Varies depending on region\u2026 How to go about it? Lawyers? Trust Fund? How do you \"pick\" the beneficiary? Not pretending to have it worked out\u2026).\n\nI was thinking about how huge that would be for anybody. Imagine not having to pay rent for an entire YEAR, but getting into a new home that actually fit your needs and allowed you to start building a sustainable life, with the option of staying in that home (taking it over) after that year if you used the time wisely enough to prepare for that?  \n\nThat would be huge.  That would definitely do the trick. It would solve a lot of issues.  Maybe even fight the ever rising homeless numbers. Talk about a \"shot in the arm\" for a struggling person(s), for a society.\n \nAnd what if you could do that every year for different people? Hopefully putting them on the same path of \"paying it forward\" to other people in need when they got the chance??\n\nI don't know, maybe all the eggnog and Christmas spirit has gotten to me, but I know I would love to do that for someone (or many people!) if I could, especially after going through what my family has had to. A little goes a long way, but a lot could go even further. \nMaybe we could really make a difference. Really change the world\u2026 one person at a time?\n\nYour thoughts/opinions/comments are welcome, and sorry if this is in the wrong thread\u2026 ",

            "selftext": "Using me as an example:\n\nAnytime my phone registers I'm at a bar or restaurant that serves alcohol, it starts a timer.  I can't see the timer or stop it unless it sees I've left the bar.  When the timer hits 0, I get a robocall that asks me to repeat a phrase I wouldn't want to say to a boss or grandmother, or to say the alphabet backwards.  If I succeed, the timer starts again with a randomly generated time.  \n\nIf I start to slur, I get a warning that I should pay attention to how much I drink.  After that, the timer resets, but this time, when it hits zero, I get 5 seconds to answer and try a tongue twister again.  If I fail or don't answer in time, the app will pick a random number or email in my contacts and send the recording of the phrase to them.  For example, a family member or coworker might receive this voice memo, \"Why haven't we fucked yet?  I'm drunk and I know your DTF so let's make this happen.\"\n\nThat first time might lead to an unembarrassing result so you'd get one more chance.  Failing again will call the bar, tell them to cut you off, pay your tab, and will order a taxi or Uber driver to take you home.\n\nThe timer is just a basic idea to test sobriety.  A few others involve visual illusions that you'd fail to see drunk, \nMath problems you answer within a set time, spot the difference puzzles, etc.",

The actress that plays the character of Vicky at the time looked like a spitting image of Sheldons' Mom in Big Bang Theory... Mind:blown.\n\nI have checked and the actresses are different, but the way Sheldon's mom talks/looks/dresses seems way too similar to be pure coincidence.\n\nI don't know if this was intentional by the creators of BBT or just a huge coincidence, but I don't care. The idea that Sheldon Cooper is the hybrid offspring of an alien and human fits so perfectly with his character and ties two of my all time favourite sitcoms together in a way I would never have expected.\n\nIf I had a chance to ask the creators of BBT anything, it would be if this was an intentional nod to 3rd Rock from the Sun.",

Might solve hunger, and put an end to the evils of both capitalism and of communism.  \n\nWe have increasing surveillance and increasing processing power.  I imagine a very advanced algorithm that could review what everyone is doing all the time and good acts would give credits, while bad acts would take away credits. Not just acts that you do at/for work, but how you treat other people and whether or not you're kind to them.  Goods would be distributed based on your credits or on the deeds you did.  All products would be pooled and then distributed to those who need or requested them.  The value of the product would fluctuate based on supply and demand just like with currency.   \n\nThe efficacy of this system would depend on how well the computer could judge whether or not your action is good and helpful to others.  It would update live which products or actions are needed most which would facilitate a more effective work force.  This would take a long time and be very difficult, but I believe it is possible.  I\n\n\nThis would be different from capitalism because it's more directly tied to what you're producing.  Not something you inherited or got through nefarious purposes.  The richest people wouldn't be the ones who simply bet on the market and got lucky, or bribed politicians.  The richest people would be those who gave others what they needed and were very kind to others.  \nThis would be different from communism because it's more directly tied to how hard you work and the more you give the more you get.  \n\nThere would also be left over goods that could be distributed to the poor who are unable to for whatever reason, contribute positively to others.  The algorithm would account for talent and skill and how much is actually produced vs what they CAN produce.\n\nThis would require everyone be monitored 24/7 but it would be by a computer who was objective in its judging.  Parameters would be refined over time.  \n\nEveryone would have to be enrolled in this system, and it would be controversial and many would say it's the beast system described in the bible.",

            "selftext": "I was browsing Wikipedia one day and suddenly, a notification appears on the top of the page. It asks one simple message, to donate a meagre $3.00 to fund the upkeep and maintenance of the site. I think to myself, 'Hey, you should really donate, it's only $3.00'. What stops me is my general laziness (First World Problems, eh?), I simply cannot be bothered using my credit card to donate or using some other method. Takes too much time. But you might think, 'Hey, SwoonerOrLater, just use PayPal or something'. PayPal, although claiming to be secure (and it may very well be), it suffers the problem of just not feeling safe enough. It doesn't provide the same sense of security, like a physical credit card. \n\nNow, on to my idea. Instead of typing out numbers and security codes manually or relying on a digital wallet service like PayPal (that usually is or feels insecure), we should instead rely on using the PayPass or PayWave systems nearly everyone has in their credit cards and implement them at home. Although it may be just as secure (or insecure) as using digital wallets, most people have a feeling of improved security (probably due to [security theater](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_theater))\n\nAlso, laziness. I would rather just grab my physical credit card, swipe it across the screen instead of typing it out anyways. Would be easier to donate.",

If the battery needs to be recharged, you use a wireless charger.\n\nNow your personal data is always with **you**, regardless if you have internet access. It's still encrypted and protected by a password. And instead of everyone in the world being potentially able to access your data (including government security agencies with a warrant to snoop client data) if they hack your password, only people within several meters of you can do so.

The original idea spawned from me asking whether brain wave data could be 'converted' into an audio format. However, I asked something similar but different in context much later and it didn't fail to capture my attention more intensely: Does the sound of information in general make decent music?\n\nWe're talking what it would be like to listen to math, the alphabet, and even the symbols on your QWERTY keyboard. There wasn't a point in stopping there, though: It was our goal that the music made in the process should have the option of being personalized and created into an art form worth listening to again... and again.\n\n**How it works**\n\n1) Users can open up the software and paste information into a text box and click next.\n\n2) Our software is programmed to attach a musical note to a symbol from a database of symbolic language we've indexed (such as & and S) and link them together into a song.\n\n3) You are redirected to basic audio editing software where you can listen to the song and edit it with effects and add tracks. You can also combine and delete musical notes from one piece of music with another one, creating a new song. The possibilities are almost limitless.\n\n4) You can download your song and even share it on social networks like Facebook or Reddit.\n\n**We haven't completed building the software yet, but we would appreciate additional feedback and suggestions on our project. Feel free to ask us anything!**\n",

[Can be done easily, but I'm rather worried about copyright]\n * Use it as a **paid hotspot**, using it as a bridge to a mobile connection. If one manages to get decent speeds, it could be sold for low prices and get a lot of people to use it. [A rather complex thing to do, but I already laid most of the codebase. I'm only worried about the school finding it and taking it down.]\n * Use it as a **chat server**, maybe with IRC or something. Doable and school-legal, but I doubt many people would use it.

For example, two teams could attempt to deliver packages to their teammates without being intercepted, with the play field being their workplace. Or have players attempt to obtain an object off of the top of a building, using any means necessary (Climbing, drone, legal authorization, etc). I realize that some\\* of these games can easily go overboard and maybe get someone fired/arrested, so I've been working on creating a sturdy ruleset to help prevent this.

Police will identify the location of every gun in town, cross-reference those locations against the residences of licensed gun owners (if your community doesn't require that all guns be licensed, please imagine for the sake of this hypothetical that it does), and seek warrants to seize guns that are in homes where no licensed gun owner lives.\n\nIf the scanners detect guns that are in cars, offices, public spaces, or anywhere that isn't a residence, the police will still seek search warrants at their discretion.\n\nImagine the impact on neighborhoods that suffer from gun violence and the relief for every parent in communities plagued by the threat of shootings if that danger evaporated. Imagine the reduction in sexual violence perpetrated under threat of gun. Imagine living in an America with as little gun violence as most of the other developed countries of the world. Imagine the reduction in many police officers' fear -- well-founded or not -- that the people they are policing are armed and dangerous to police (scanner says: no gun within 500 yards).

It's free to use and easy to install. As the tool is in it's early phases, customization options are not available yet. I imagine this plugin being useful to all bloggers. I blogged between 2009-2013 and my biggest problem besides blog promotion was thinking of new post ideas that would interest my audience.\n\n**Site:** http://www.chilledlime.com/lightbulb\n\n**Demo on my blog:** http://www.akosblog.com\n\nWould love to here your thoughts and ideas.",

            "selftext": "Starting from Windows Vista, pressing ctrl+alt+del brings you to this screen that lets you \"Lock this Computer,\" \"Switch User,\" \"Log off, \"Change a password..,\" or \"Start Task Manager.\" The significance of ctrl+alt+del is that it interrupts the system kernel meaning that it gets higher priority over most other actions you do (in other words, ctrl+shift+esc or right clicking the task bar doesn't have as high of a priority to your operating system as ctrl+alt+del does)\n\nHow many people press ctrl+alt+del to change their password or to switch user? Why couldn't these features just be incorporated into the task manager itself for those that actually do use ctrl+alt+del to log off/do whatever like it was in Windows XP? Based on my observations and my own experience, people commonly use the task manager when programs are not responding or are running slowly. When programs are running so slowly, the computer as a whole is typically also running slowly which makes this extra screen that users have to go through when pressing ctrl+alt+del even more annoying. As someone who is the sole user of this computer, there is absolutely no need for me to have these options when pressing ctrl+alt+del. At the very least, Microsoft could've made an option where users can disable the extra unnecessary screen but nope--there isn't even a registry entry that users can edit.\n\nFor something that interrupts the system kernel, I'd think that ending a non-responding or unstable process quickly is more important than changing your password and switching users.",

I've gotten so sick of sites like last.fm and Pandora that recommend me artists that I don't like because of certain qualities, like the types of vocals. Basically, this would be a website, app, whatever... that allows the user to specify what they like about specific artists. \n\n* Say you like the beat of artist x, the vocals and harmonies of artist y, and the instrumentals of artist z. This tool would use a specific algorithm to find artists that retain all 3 of those qualities, or something that closely resembles it. \n\n* You'd be able to pull up the app on your phone to whatever song you're listening to. From there, it drops down a list of dozens of song specific qualities. You pick and choose what you like about the song. \n\n* This is retained in the database and from there, it tailors new music specifically to the types of qualities you like. Think of it as a much more in depth version of Pandora except you're specifying what you like about each song. \n\n* When you first set up the account, you'd list all artists you're familiar with on a scale of 1-5. This keeps recommendations fresh so you're not getting obvious choices like Led Zeppelin. I stopped going to Pandora when it would recommend 70% of my iTunes library. \n* You could also specify what you don't like about specific artists. \n\n* In addition, it uses other users preferences to help find you new music. For example, say you like the vocals of T Swift and the blast beat of Lamb of God, this would \"connect\" in a sense to other users that like those same qualities, allowing you to discover others favorite music based on their same likes. If that makes any sense.\n\nProblems:\n\n* Song qualities only applicable to that specific song. What I mean is, you wouldn't list screaming as a quality in pop songs. \n* Terms that are easy enough for the general public to understand but specific enough to differentiate among different artists. I know basic music terms but I'm not familiar with the crazier stuff. \n\nThis might be a dumb idea but I've always wanted to get people's feedback. I realize it'd be a pretty niche market and this might already exist. Hopefully that explains what I'm thinking of.\n\ntl;dr A website/app that allows you to pick apart different qualities/aspects of songs to tailor music to your specific likes and disregard your dislikes of those songs. \n",

People see the image (sometimes only the thumbnail!), and immediately pass their judgement without any further context.  How many times have you gone into a comment thread on a picture on the front page only to find out that it's fake, or it's a repost, or there's some other reason it shouldn't be on the front page, but here it is with 8,000 points?  How many times have you seen an article hit the front page that was either horribly written, or is 8 years old, or is just plain wrong?\n\nThe same thing happens with comments.  People make snap decisions with little or no actual reason behind them and that's not how the voting system is supposed to work.\nUpvotes are for content that adds to the discussion or presents new information or a valid view on the subject.  Downvotes are for comments that don't do any of these things.  It's not an \"I disagree\" button, but that's exactly how people treat it.  \n\nForcing people to explain WHY they are making these decisions would help alleviate this problem.  Because nobody wants to actually admit they downvoted you for no reason just because they didn't like what you said.  This would also put a huge dent in any vote manipulation since it's an extra step, though it won't stop the dedicated karma farmers.  \n\nI just think this site needs a change somewhere.

            "selftext": "The UK and other European governments have historically provided grants for films to be made there. In the US, public funding for such projects is severely lacking. I want to take it a step further.\n\nHere's the idea: Congress appropriates a tiny percentage of its 3.9 trillion dollars in expenditures for federally-funded films. A reasonable amount would be 400 million. [(For comparison, NASA is requesting 17.4 billion for FY 2015](http://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/files/508_2015_Budget_Estimates.pdf) [and Hollywood spends hundreds of billions per year.)](http://mentalfloss.com/article/54440/why-do-hollywood-movies-cost-so-much-make) \n\nOnce the 400 million has been granted, taxpayers wait until January of the coming year to hit a government-run website which allows filmmakers to post Kickstarter and IndieGoGo-like campaigns. Projects are broken into short films and feature-lengths and further divided by genre. They are then up-voted or down-voted by users. Voting requires registration tied to your SSN and Voter ID and each user gets 5 votes for short films and 10 votes for feature lengths per year. Filmmakers also must register with their SSN and Voter ID, can only have one feature length campaign per year or two short films, and cannot be funded by any studio. If a filmmaker has any FFF campaign going at one time, they cannot vote on other projects.\n\nThe winners will be the top 10 feature lengths and top 20 short films per year. Feature lengths will have a total of 300 million to spend. Short films will have a total of 100 million to spend. Each feature length will have a maximum budget of 30 million and a minimum budget of 5 million. Each short film will have a maximum budget of 5 million and a minimum budget of 1 million.\n\nIn order for projects to receive the money, they must submit budgets clearly outlining how every dollar will be spent. They must also have completed scripts ready to be read by the public and storyboarding if possible. Additionally, they must include shooting locations, shooting schedules (including time of the year), shooting permits, and a post-production schedule. The only disqualifications for content will be anything which would typically receive above an R rating by the MPAA (extremely graphic and/or sexual content). Everything else is fair game and decided on by taxpayers.\n\nIn order to avoid a \"take the money and run\" scenario, filmmakers will be visited by a Federally Funded Films representative beforehand and receive funds in chunks. For instance, if a feature length drama wins 30 million at the end of the year and has selected March of the next year for shooting, then they will receive enough funding for the first third of the shooting schedule (say, in this case, 10 million). As the end of that first third wraps up, a representative from FFF will visit again and ensure the money is being spent on the project. Receipts will be checked. If nothing fishy is going on, then the next 10 million will be released and the final 10 million will be released when the final third of the shooting schedule approaches. If at any point funds are being spent on anything outside of the film project, then funding will be canceled and the recipient may be liable for what has been paid.\n\nAfter a project is completed, it will be up to the filmmaker to find a distributor and to continue to be successful. If a film grosses well at the box office (over its budget by any amount), the government will receive 50% of this money back. Filmmakers will have a lifetime limit of 2 feature length projects and 5 short film projects.",

You personalize the cards and the codes are added by the manufacturer. If you're in the service industry 5% off labor charges or reduced service fees and retail could be discounts on certain items. I wouldn't care to participate in the Monopoly game at McDonalds if no one ever won. There has to be a credible entity that will keep everything honest and in accordance with sweepstakes laws.\n\nAny way to encourage people to keep your card or visit your showroom can be a huge boost.

Here is one that's simple and free, just needs to be widely adopted.\n\nReason this is a problem is that when Caller A is trying to attempt to call Caller B, and Caller B is attempting to make a call, Caller A is directed right to Caller B's voicemail. After a dropped call, this is when both callers try to reach the other back, resulting in both being unable to reconnect. Phone carriers have not solved this. A simple rule should help.\n\nEdit: /u/sionnach had a much simpler idea -- everyone agrees that the original caller of the call that was dropped is required to call back.\n\nOld/original suggestion:\nIt can be based on the first letter of the callers' names. Whoever has the one earlier in the alphabet is designated as the only person to try to call back. If both letters are the same, then move to the next letter, etc.",

            "selftext": "This was borne out of a recent discussion over on Hacker News.\n\nImagine if Reddit had a feature where anyone who downvoted a post was required to state why they did so? As it stands, the blue button is mostly used as a drive by \"I disagree with this\", Reddiquette be damned. A downvote is treated very, *very* lightly, rather than the democratic pseudo-ban that it actually is.\n\nIt would work like this. You click the blue button, and a text field appears, you enter why you're downvoting. This information is made available, configurably, to the moderators of the subreddit, as well as the user being downvoted.\n\nBS or nonsensical downvotes can be cancelled based on set rules (leave the box blank? cancelled. Enter garbage? cancelled.), or by the subreddit mods. This would allow each community to have their own standards for what is downvotable.\n\nNow, this whole \"refunding\" functionality only works if this is a Reddit feature. I could put together a browser addon (possibly even submit this to the RES guys) that emulates most of the features. The reasons and \"modified\" scores would be sent to a server - the difference between actual score and \"modified\" score could be used to determine how well a user follows the rules of the places they post.\n\nThis is something I could see myself using, if a critical mass of people think that it may be a good idea.\n\nAny thoughts? Is this just dumb, or does it have legs?",

In essence, what if instead of manufacturing a costly vaccine, there was a way to simply \"upload\" your body's knowledge of how to fight various diseases onto the internet, or better yet into a peer-to-peer network like BitTorrent, letting it spread from person to person all across the planet in an instant?\n\nWhat if only one person had to get sick with a particular strain of the cold or flu, and once they had, just a day or two later a huge portion of humanity instantly became resistant to that particular strain? What if one random person somewhere in the world managed to miraculously fight off HIV and on their own, and having done it they were then able to share that immunity with the rest of the world at the speed of light?\n\nThe implications are mind-boggling.",

            "selftext": "This is an idea I posted on Scribd.com some time ago (read it at: *scribd.com/doc/231997998/Terrorist-Act-Credit-Auctions* ). Anyway, here is the gist of it: \n\n*A car-bomb explodes in a bustling Baghdad bazaar. Immediately a middle-school student in Ohio bids $1 to claim responsibility in the name of excessive homework, but bidding quickly rises to $150 to protest an unfair divorce settlement. The winning bid goes to the Red Crescent, which publishes the result on its website.*\n\nBasically the sheer audacity of such auctions could render terrorist acts relatively less valuable to the people who commit them; and might compel local reforms related to the winning bid. For example, if the world learned that credit for a mall shooting was won by someone complaining of a specific Walk signal that is too brief, that signal would likely be fixed sooner rather than later. \n\nInitially such auctions would probably be held on the Dark Web via Tor, with payments made to relevant charities using Bitcoins or other virtual currencies. Such payments might be guaranteed by the emerging technology of \"smart contracts\" within a DAC (Decentralized Autonomous Corporation).  \n\nIt seems to me a very do-able idea, and there would be no end of people willing to participate. Initially, bidding levels would probably be very low, increasing gradually as such auctions gained popularity and/or notoriety. ",

            "selftext": "Motivated by frustration with logical fallacies and dishonest debate/argument tactics, I have some ideas for a website that I think (i.e. hope) could fix that (if there's a better place for me to post this, please tell me).\n\nMy ultimate goal is to teach people to be logical. I think the way to do this is to force (not quite the right word, but I can't find a better one. Clarification of what I mean by \"force\" in next paragraph) people to confront opposing arguments, and either exposing or rendering ineffective any fallacies or dishonest tactics.\n\nThe website will work better with more users (ideally, I'd like it to be the go-to place for debating/arguing, in the way Wikipedia is the go-to place for information), so to encourage more usage, excuses to not use the website should be minimized. The only legitimate excuse to not use it should be apathy. Once someone is willing to argue/debate a topic, any excuse to not use the website should be either false (the websites rules should make those easily correctable) or equivalent to admitting being unreasonable (refusing to use the website because your ad hominem arguments don't prove your point is not a problem with the website). If a reason to not use the website doesn't fit either of those, there's a real problem with the way the site works, and it should be addressed.\n\nNow, my ideas:\n\n* One of the ways I've come up with to summarize the idea is \"what Wikipedia is to cite-able facts, this website is to lines of argument\". Each claim gets a page, with arguments about it on it's page, and counterarguments branching off the arguments like reddit comments. Arguments link to the premises (which get their own page because they're separate claims) and evidence (external link, or reference to where the evidence can be found) they're based on.\n\n* To counter an argument: If the argument is based on a false premise, go to the premise's page and argue against it. If the argument uses bad logic or a logical fallacy, post a counterargument to it on the same page explaining why it's wrong. Counterarguments themselves can be countered.\n\n* Debates and arguments often end up re-arguing points that have been argued before by others (or sometimes by the same people), resulting in no new progress. To fix this, consolidate the arguments. Any duplicate claims/arguments are merged together.\n\n* Often in debates, someone's argument will bring up several new topics, or make several claims at once, and if the other side tries to address them all, the argument will grow exponentially out of control. The consolidation fixes this. Once a claim has been discussed, if someone brings it up in an argument, just link to the claim's page.\n\n* Censor as little as possible. If an argument is wrong (or even blatantly/stupidly wrong), don't remove it. There's probably someone out there who believes it, so instead, explain why it's wrong. The only things that should be removed are non-arguments, posts that aren't even trying to prove/disprove/argue for/against the claim/argument (e.g. gibberish, spam, or ads).\n\n* As much anonymity as possible. It weakens any attempted ad hominem attacks, and encourages people to post arguments they might not post without that anonymity.\n\n* People don't have to agree with what they post. They can post other people's arguments specifically to debunk/argue against them. This will help add content to the website at first when it's not as well known. This could lead to strawman arguments, but the solution to that is for the other side to post it's own actual arguments (encouraging more users).\n\n* To stop people from just assuming a premise is true or false, I'd like the links to arguments' premises to also indicate the current state of the premise. That state will be recursively based on arguments for/against it and their premises. That way, if a premise of someone's argument is debunked, they'll notice, and have to go to the premise's page and argue there in order to prove their point.\n\nI expect 2 kinds of claims: Factual and moral. The main difference is the word \"should\". For example, \"X is illegal\" vs. \"X should be illegal\" (law vs. politics).\n\nSubjective claims are allowed, but because of their nature, users shouldn't expect to prove or debunk them, just offer reasons for and against.\n\nI keep thinking that, with this website and the right arguments, a ton of debates could be resolved, which could solve a ton of problems. But, I might have a bias or blind spot I'm not aware of, so I'm sharing the idea for feedback.",

            "selftext": "For some reason, my circle of friends and acquaintances includes an inordinate amount of independent musicians.  Everybody is trying to make it...whatever that happens to mean...  Now music distribution (and especially profiting off it) at this level is fairly difficult.  We're talking bands/dj's that play the bar and small venue scene in Brooklyn and Manhattan.  At these gigs the crowd basically consists of a bunch of drunk 20-somethings that, for the most part, will have absolutely no recollection of seeing your band play the previous night, and will also have no desire to check out your SoundCloud or BandCamp while they're recovering from their hangover (again, if they even remember your name after seeing four other bands on the same stage).  Besides throwing out the usual \"Check out our Facebook page!\" at the end of the set, there are many bands that still resort to selling CD's.  CD's...like it's the 90's...  That is disturbing to me.  I've looked around for other ways for my friends to try and get their names out there, but so far I haven't found anything that doesn't involve iTunes or paying someone to get it on Pandora or Spotify.  Distributing music at live shows for independent bands is difficult and seemingly archaic.  So I tossed this problem around for a while and came up with my Ideal Solution.\n\nIn a Perfect World this is how I would do it:\n\n1.  Bands upload music to website/database/cloud/whathaveyou instead of burning them to a CD\n2.  Website attaches song to QR Code or something similar.\n3.  Band prints out, or downloads on to another device, all of the codes.\n4.  Band goes to gig and plays.\n5.  Instead of convincing Drunken Peoples to remember their SoundCloud name, they convince Drunken Peoples to give them a dollar or two or whatever they want to charge it is their music after all to scan the QR Code\n6.  Song gets downloaded from website/database/cloud/thingy on to person's phone in to their music folder or into their iCloud\n7.  Drunken Person goes home and wakes up as Hungover Person and completely forgets the band they saw the previous night.\n8.  Hungover Person throws on their iPod and suddenly they hear one of the songs from the night before\n9.  \"Those guys were actually pretty decent, I should check out their SoundCloud...\"\n\nThat is the best I could come up with.  I have no idea how feasible this is.  I know QR codes are used for advertising, especially in the music world nowadays, and I know that an mp3 is usually too big a file to transfer directly using a QR code, but I figure there's got to be a way to just use the scanning as some sort of gimmick in order to signal to the website that this phone wants this particular song and it should be transferred to their cloud.\n\nAs far as business goes.  Ideally you would charge the bands about a dollar per song to attach to the code, preferably with an expiration date set on it.  The bands then charge as much as they want/can get away with.  Get enough bands to use this as their method of distribution when they play Live, and you've got yourself a pretty solid business goin.  Again that's my Ideal Solution in a Perfect World.  I'll leave it to you guys to tell me how possible it is.\n\n\n",

Showering with water is one of the few human practices that hasn't yet changed since time immemorial. Most \"dry-showers\" of today - much like \"dry shampoos\" - aren't very hygienic; they only eliminate odour causing bacteria which is basically the same as putting on some perfume. A real dry shower would fulfil the same hygienic role as a normal shower, mainly preventing not only odour but also disease and infection. It would also save time - about 48 hours a year given an average 8 min shower - and water - about 33000 litres per person per year, about the same volume as a normal freight container...and money of course (greywater - water discharged from showers for example - is recycled but I think it's still a waste and using water is ancient af).

I blogged between 2009-2013 and my biggest problem besides blog promotion was thinking of new post ideas that would interest my audience.\n\n**Site:** http://www.chilledlime.com/lightbulb\n\n**Demo on my blog:** http://www.akosblog.com\n\nWould love to here your thoughts and ideas.",

You looted this house three weeks ago, but could only carry the sugar and the blankets; you had to leave the medical supplies and the rest of the food behind.

            "selftext": "40% of users of reddit (and probably the whole internet at large) are from the US. As a result, quite a lot of the content on here is relevant only to that demographic. \n\nAs a 'foreigner' I don't really give a rats ass about weirdly specific politcal issues, sports stuff (super bowl or whatever it's called) etc.\n\nHere's the solution. 'Scale' the upvotes/downvotes according to the percentage of userbase from a country. \n\nI'm not sure my math is completely correct but here's an example:\n\n% of users from Country A: 40% = 0.4 .... Now, make each upvote's 'value' =\n\n    (1.0 - 0.4) * (1 upvote) = 0.6 upvote\n\n% of users from Country B: 10% = 0.1\n\n    (1.0-0.1) * (1 upvote) = 0.9 upvote\n\nPretty basic inverse relation, or maybe just\n\n    (1/0.4) for Country A and (1/0.1) for Country B\n\n\nSo, each vote has the same value. This sort of system would be perfect in global subreddits like /r/worldnews where stories from around the world deserve equal attention instead of being driven by where the majority of the userbase is. Obviously, this shouldn't be implemented in *every* subreddit but only 'global' ones. How we define that, I'm not so sure..\n\nEdit: Or we could just wait. Majority of the world will get internet before 2030 (I hope). So, we're probably going to see a huge shift in content. India and china alone make up like 2.5 billion people (seriously, stop humping so much lol), that's like ~6 times as much as the US alone. That's bound to have a major impact on this issue. But I guess eventually as the majority of the world catches up to US/EU, developer countries, we're going to see much more generalized content that's relevant everywhere.",

Everyone gets the same fictional budget, and whoever spends the most on a player wins.

Whatever is on the screen would always remain legible.\n\nAnd why positional tracking? The image look different when you look at the screen from at a 30 degree angle, for example. Combined with positional tracking, the system would be able to solve that by distorting the image.\n\nIt can also be combined with responsive designed apps and websites for a better experience.\n\nHow about input? I'm thinking about hand gestures maybe, like how the Kinect works with the Xbox, and voice input.\n\nJohnny Lee, who is now working on the project tango, made something similar a few years ago by using a wiimote but he had only VR applications in mind. \n\nhttp://youtu.be/Jd3-eiid-Uw\n\nThe same concept can be applied to smartphones and tablets.\n\nOf course, it wouldn't work well with all applications, like video editing.",

Currently the federal gas tax in the US is at 18.4 cents per gallon.  We can say, for example, let's take the last 5 years of global temperatures and compare that to the average global temperature since an arbitrary year like 1950.  We charge, or take away, $1.00 of gas tax for every degree difference.  Global warming believers will like it because they believe global warming is happening, so increases in temperature should force people to stop using gas.  Global warming deniers will also support it because they believe high temperatures are just a recent anomaly and if the temperature is just .18 degrees lower than average, the gas tax disappears.

It's called tactile-tactile sensory substitution. You stimulate neurons on, say, an x-cm^2 area of skin, which your brain eventually learns to interpret as touching something.\n\nSomething similar has been done with magnetic implants; people can sense magnetic fields by having magnets implanted in their fingers. The magnetic fields make the magnet vibrate, and the brain can interpret that as the presence of a magnetic field. A sort of sixth sense. This could be modified (using either magnets or other ways to stimulate neurons according to touch feedback) to give more realistic touch sensing to prosthetics; you vibrate the magnets or stimulate the neurons at different intensities depending on how much pressure is sensed.\n\nBach-y-Rita did something similar with a leprosy patient who lost his peripheral sensation. The patient was equipped with a glove containing artificial contact sensors that stimulated skin sensory receptors on his forehead. After training, he was able to feel his wife, which he hadn't been able to do for 20 years. This could be adapted easily to prosthetic limbs; easier, even, since there is still peripheral sensation. You could stimulate the sensory receptors closer to the prosthesis, in order to eliminate the need for (long) wires.",

            "selftext": "TLDR version: Artificial Idiot programming that occasionally breaks the rules because seriously a perfect AI is boring even if its perfectly balanced between challenge and ease.\n\nWe can work out a plot later. The idea is that there aren't a lot of comedy games other than point-n-click adventures. Most games are either thought of either violent or stupid. While those are okay, they're getting old. We need to make hilarity ensue in some games and I know how.\n\nHilarity is normally in two forms. Think about cartoons. What do we laugh at? The absurd, and the satirical. While satire may be scripted, its not interactive like the rest of the game so that's another thought. What can work is an Absurdity Generator.\n\nThe concept is simple. Our psychology sets rules and expect stuff to follow it. We laugh when they break it somewhat, but get weirder out when it gets really broken. So we make AI stand for Artificial Idiot.\n\nHow? Programming should go into two layers: Rules and Law. Laws are physics, and breaking them means breaking the game. Rules however, like a car staying on the road though, can be broken without breaking the game. So the AI needs to do something dumb occasionally, like have a car run a red light, pull into a paralell parking spot after smashing the car in front, and the guy walks out like \"Yeah I crushed that car, problem?\" Or other rule breakers like a horse that can climb super steep cliffs without speed reduction, or a Spear Mint or a AK47 squirrel launcher or something. Stuff that obeys the rules usually, but sometimes does the unexpected. Stuff that has a random chance of being something ridiculous that only looks like something normal.\n\nThe idea is to make like 1/20 times when something normal happens (but more randomly), something breaks the rules. Think Animaniacs. They always break rules, they're funny too. Make the AI break rules too. Let it drop a few Anvils of Amusing Injuries.",

            "selftext": "One of my first jobs was working at a grocery store. I was there for a few years, and one of the things I found out was what happened to that lettuce that's got slime on one side of it, those bananas covered in brown spots, those bags of potatoes that are wrinkled and dusty looking. You might think they go to a food bank or find a good home. But you're wrong.\n\nFood banks do pick up some produce, but they still have standards. And to be fair, most of the stuff that gets pulled is just not something you'd feel good about giving another person to eat.\n\nMost of the produce that gets pulled, gets thrown away. And I'm not talking about a few things here and there, I'm talking about 50 to 100 pounds of fruits and veggies a day at a decent sized supermarket. It would make you sick to see such needless waste firsthand.\n\nSo my idea that I had was, what if there were a way to take all that organic waste, dry it, compact it, and turn it into a sort of bio-coal? Because in many poor nations, and in the poor parts of the country you live in, people rely on coal or wood for cooking and heat, but it's hard to come by. A reliable fuel for making a fire is important to the lives of millions of people in a way that many of us will thankfully never have to truly understand.\n\nIf there was a way to collect that expired produce instead of letting it get thrown in a trash compacter, perhaps mixing it with municipal yard waste, and processing it into heating fuel, and then donating it or at least selling it for a pittance to people who needed it, and making the whole process cost effective (the most important part), that would be a hell of a thing.\n",

            "selftext": "Okay, I've been throwing this idea at people for years, they all tell me I'm nuts. I still think it's brilliant and just discovered this sub, so here goes.\n\nI want a mouse that has arrow keys. Wouldn't look or feel much different, just replace the scroll wheel with up and down buttons, fit between the existing left and right mouse buttons. It could still function like any other mouse, the up/down keys could retain the scrolling functionality. For all non gaming intents and purposes nothing would change. But for gaming everything would change, and for the better.\n\nFor a first or third person shooter the impact is huge. All character movement and aiming would happen in one hand, turning complex maneuvers into simple one handed gestures, and more importantly freeing the other hand to make use of the entire keyboard.  \n\nThe usual WASD (or ESDF) control scheme forces us to make a critical trade off: you must let go of control in order to execute auxiliary commands. It's like driving a race car that requires two steering wheels. If you want to shift gears you have to let go of one of your steering wheels. Madness.\n\nThe thumb can access spacebar, alt, and maybe ctrl if you have long nimble fingers. The pinky has access to tab, caps, shift, ctrl, tilde, and maybe 1, but it gets awkward from there. Your remaining and most dexterous digits are anchored to WASD, which means any other key on the keyboard requires letting go of your movement controls. Some of us moved over to ESDF to give the pinky more keys, namely 1, q, a, z, and alt. But the rest of the keyboard is still off limits until you relinquish control. \n\nThe arrow key mouse completely removes the trade off, and in my mind would blend movement and aim into a single, more fluid, action. \n",

            "selftext": "OK, I've put **way** too much thought into this but I'm sort of sick of turning on the tv and only seeing a small handful of the same tired sports played over and over again. I think it would be great if we could see a much greater diversity in the sports we watch at a high level. So my idea is:\n\nTwo teams of seven players playing seven sports over the course of either a single day or a weekend on a single indoor playing field. It would be as much a test of endurance as a test of skill. Matches would be won by who wins the most number of events. It could be called 'Seven Sevens', 'Seven Ball' or maybe just 'Sevens'. Or 'Team Heptathlon' if you're boring. \n\nThe sports would be modified seven-person variants of current popular sports played for two halves of seven minutes each:\n\n1. Basketball \n\n2. Volleyball \n\n3. Handball\n\n4. Football (soccer that is)  \n\n5. Dodgeball\n\n6. Floorball (basically Floor Hockey) \n\n7. Indoor Lacrosse\n\n\n\n\nOf course it could also include different sports, perhaps depending on the country. I'm leery however about sports which need special arenas or expensive equipment. It needs to be capable of being played in your average gymnasium. Or sports for that matter whose rules or skill sets are a bit too 'overly specialized' like Baseball or Cricket.\n\nFundamentally it would be a game that would test the most important aspects of team sports. Not just raw athleticism but teamwork, leadership, strategy and sheer tenacity. \n\nOne of the problems I think would be substitutions. You don't want teams to substitute in specialized ringers for individual sports. One way would be to randomize the list of sports so players can't anticipate what games are coming up. Also you could limit the number and frequency of substitutions and even randomize the list of which players are sent on next. \n\nThere could be a bigger outdoor version 'Ten Tens' which happens over the course of a week and a shorter smaller version called 'Five Fives'. A Water-version (Synchronized Swimming, Water Polo, Swimming Relay, Underwater Hockey, Rowing). And, of course an Ice-Version. (Ice Hockey, Curling, Bobsleigh, Synchronized Skating and Team Ski-Jumping). \n\nThere could be a less intensive version for schools played over a series for days. It would be a good match as it would teach students a whole *series* of different sports. Instead of just a small group of specialised skill sets.\n\nWhat do you think? Are there any sports you think I've missed out?\n\n\n\n**TL:DR: See Title**\n\n\nEDIT: I've been thinking about a scoring system for league play. Every 'match' awards 3 points for a Win, 1 point for a draw and 0 points for a loss. But additionally you get an extra point for every individual event you win in each match. Theoretically even if you lose a match, if you won three events, you could still be awarded 3 points. That means there's still an incentive to keep playing the rest of the events even if you've already lost.\n\nEDIT 2: By the way, 'Lacrosse' doesn't fit with the names of the other events. So maybe, just for 'Sevens' it should be renamed to something like Stickball, or Skyball, or Airball or Crossball or something.\n",

            "selftext": "Hello everyone! I've been thinking more and more about the Israel-Palestinian conflict, when an idea struck me...Also, before I start, I apologize for incorrect use of any terminology and will fix whatever is pointed out...\n\nWould a Two-State solution with a Bicameral Parliament Confederation with two Prime Ministers work? Perhaps say with citizens from Israel electing based on population for their house and then a set number (48?) for their senate. Palestine does the same with population-based for their house and a set number for their senate (48?). \n\nTheir Judicial Branch will be composed of four candidates from each nation, elected by vote from both Israel and Palestine (So say a guy from Israel runs to be on the Judicial Branch, he'll be elected by the people of both Israel and Palestine). A maximum of ten candidates per nation can run each election cycle. The four with the highest percentage of votes (I believe it's called Instant Runoff Voting) become the four for each nation. \nAn eleventh Judge is picked either by the Prime Ministers (Bickering is a drawback), or as the man with the highest number of votes out of the twenty candidates for Judicial duties that DID NOT win an election. \n\nFrom there, the four Palestinians will vote for one Israeli Judge of the four to be the Israeli Prime Minister and the four Israeli's will do the same to get one Palestinian Prime Minister. The eleventh judge will act as a tiebreaker for any ties. Both of these will act as heads of state for their respective country, but will act together in most foreign affairs. \n\nSo, then, it's technically two separate nations, but they intermingle a great deal on a governmental level and act as one made of two at the foreign level.\nIsraeli and Palestinian armies will act as one in foreign affairs, but they will each have their own internal military force. They will have one unified police force across the confederation. Citizens of each country will be able to travel between the two countries with relative ease. \nThe main idea is that Palestine becomes a recognized state, while not really compromising the safety, territory, or integrity of the Israeli state. \n\nIs this a viable idea to end the conflict, or at least dampen it?\nAgain, sorry for the wall of text, any incorrect usage of terminology, and perhaps simply making it too hard to understand (Because I didn't write it in a coherent way). I'd love to hear feedback, criticisms (Positive or Negative), and answer any questions regarding anything that's unclear. Thank you!",

            "selftext": "Imagine an online store with a large selection of affordable tabletop RPG rule sets and scenarios. Any book has a nice preview, then you can download it in the format of your choice instantly or have it printed and mailed to you. For a given book, you even have a choice of which art in it you want. You also see a breakdown of where every cent from you purchase is going, if you wish.\n\nHere's how it works from the contributors standpoint. Someone writes a campaign for an existing game. He uploads the campaign to the site and sets a fixed price of how much he gets per sale. He then shops around for an editor. Editors able to view previews of the work through the site. They come to an agreement for the editor to partner on the project, and set a commission rate for the editor.\n\nAfter a few back and forths with the editor, the campaign story is finalized. The author gives final approval, and the book is now \"soft released\" and viewable by certain other contributers.\n\nA layout editor looks through these semi-finished books and picks one. He sets whatever price he wants and formats the layout, using placeholders for pictures. He can see if other people are working on layouts for this book and how much time they've spent (but not what they've done) to avoid duplicate work.\n\nA graphic artist sorts through books that have been laid out. She makes graphics for all the placeholders. She also sets her own price.\n\nThe book is now published. Every person's commission is stacked on top of each other. A markup is added as a flat percentage for the advertiser that referred the sale. If there wasn't a referrer, it goes to the website.\n\nLast is a markup that goes to the website. This is a percentage that remains constant across all books.\n\nIf the purchaser wants a paper copy, then they choose a printer and pay their calculated fee as well.\n\nBooks are organized in ways you'd expect. By genre, and with lists of new, trending, top scores, top sellers, etc. As a user, you can look at a little pie chart and see where all of your money is going.\n\n    $2.00 Author\n    $0.75 Editor \n    $0.90 Layout \n    $1.25 Graphics  \n    $0.60 Marketing  \n    $2.50 Tabletop Source\n    ----\n    $8.00 Total ebook \n    \n    $6.00 Printing\n    ----\n    $14.00 Total dead tree\n\nThe idea is to create an open process for people to do their work. Create a tool, then get out of their way. It's pretty clear that publisher's power in printed media is slipping. This just takes it to the extreme.",

Inversely, when the negative filter is clicked the negative news stories appear. Logistically this would be hard, due to many factors such as the subjectivity of what is good and bad.

I study mechatronics and if everything goes as planned, in the future I should earn more than my family needs, so that connected with the thing that I don't care about material goods and having fancy stuff means I could share my income with another family, whose job/passion is less reliable, for example musicians.

I imagine a huge MMO open world and you basically set traps for animals that can be tracked, or even other players. You can collect plans for different traps and set lures with your own equipment. When you're exploring you'd be notified if your trap has been triggered. Whether it's a player or animal, it can still free itself depending on time/quality of the trap. \n\nI mean it'd be great if there were no plans, but rather player made, ingenuity, but that might be a little more complicated. I guess it's concept is survival and the sense of urgency, but at the same time maybe you're already being tracked and running into a trap. Idk. Just an idea.",

One example would be acne medication. The app would remind you once or twice a day (depending on your preference) to take a photo of yourself and it would keep all of these photos in one place. Then you could look at them after say a month and see if your acne has improved. You could do this with several products and compare the results over your specified time period.\n\nAlternatively, instead of photos it could be a simple text entry, so the app would ask you every day to write down in detail and describe any improvements or changes with the product/medication.\n\nAnother side of this could be that people's results would be accessible to others using the app, so you could look up a product like Neutrogena Face Wash and see how well it works with people who are actually using/have used the product. It could be incredibly useful with prescription medications, diet pills, supplements, or any number of things.",

The political policy that represents our beliefs is not currently held by our politicians. Lets fucking get out and vote for people who will. I know that sounds basic and stupid, but its fucking true. Our voter participation rate is only 54%. It\u2019s a fucking travesty, but its not. As a polisci major I am literally told that rational people will not vote. The value of voting is not worth the costs because your vote does not have the power to be decisive in a pool of one million votes. However, that isn\u2019t true anymore. Everyday I watch things get voted to the front page of reddit. That\u2019s five thousand votes. Those can fucking matter. SO LETS FUCKING DO IT. I am a member of a Chicago sub reddit. TELL ME WHO TO VOTE FOR IN THE RUNOFF AND I WILL. Most people don\u2019t fucking know. As a polisci major, I am literally told people do not know what they are voting for which is true. I don\u2019t even know all the initiatives I am voting for anymore and I fucking study politics at a renowned university. It takes to much time for one person. But we are not one person, we are a massive community with similar views that would likely vote the same way, so tell me what to fucking vote for, and ill trust that its in our best interest. I think about things. Whats one thing that reddit fucking hates? Student loan debt. What if the government just paid for anyone who couldn\u2019t afford their debt. I know that sounds ridiculously stupid, but when its done for major banks its called TARP. We vote for the politicians who bailout ford, why not vote for politicians who will bail out us. Lets fucking do it because if we cant, how hard is it to walk to the post office and vote. Would you not walk to the post office to get your student loans paid? Lets find a politician that would do it for us. And I know that sounds like stupid politics, but as an economics major I can tell you it isn\u2019t. Student loan affects largely the middle class. If we get rid of the student loan debt, it is essentially like giving cash to the middle class. That will literally foster the growth of the middle class. Why are we surprised when giving money to a select few companies leads to growing inequality? Lets have our country give our tax money back to the middle class because its good for THE MAJORITY OF VOTERS. Why am I still writing this. Lets find politicians together that believe the same shit we do, and lets change the fucking world. I know it sounds crazy, but as a history lover I can tell you that it has happened before. After the hippie movement in the 1960s a man named Lyndon Johnson came into power. That was in 1963-1969. The biggest hippie time. Do you think that president supported Big Corporate? Hell no he wanted the Great Society look it up if you don\u2019t know what it is. It will only take you off reddit for five minutes I promise. I am now actually done talking. I am calling this movement #Dylan because I fucking love Bob Dylan and he talked a lot about injustices I despise in his music. And why the fuck not Bob Dylans the fucking man\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOf course this is a throwaway,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBobby D\n\n\n",

Someone brought up joke sites (of which [this one](http://hasthelargehadroncolliderdestroyedtheworldyet.com/) has always been my favorite).\n\nThere should really be a joke site generator for things like that. I see that yet.com doesn't seem to be a real website right now. If it were possible to take ownership of that domain you could make it so the first part of the URL was the question. For example the DiCaprio question would become:\n\nhasLeonardoDiCaprioWonAnOscar.yet.com\n\nGoing to just the url yet.com would be a landing page where you could set the configuration for a particular site (such as answering \"Yes\" on a particular day of the year like [this site](https://isitchristmas.com/) does).

Spore and Black & White were both awesome concepts, but while they had their solid points, they failed to deliver on their promises. Democracy 3 looks pretty cool, and has cool gameplay.\n\nIn this hypothetical game, you would control a tropical island that is highly isolated from the rest of the world. Along with controlling the people of the island, you could also control the island's wildlife, making them evolve, or even placing exotic and extinct species, such as elephants and dinosaurs, and creating/altering the island terrain to make rainforests, mountains, and the like. You can also \"evolve\" these creatures by changing their features ala Spore.\n\nYou are also in control of the island's people. You can assign jobs to them, make them worship you, and similarly to Democracy 3, change certain laws, like making them follow sexual or dietary laws. Dietary and health laws in particular can either increase or decrease health or lifespan of your people. You can either bless the island's people with good luck, or curse them with natural disasters.\n\nSometimes, foreign people will come to your island, in airplanes or by ship. You can choose to welcome or reject them. The attention that your island brings can either positively or negatively affect it, depending on who discovers it and when. If it is discovered before 1950, the impact is likely to be negative. If it is discovered after 1990, it is likely to be positive.",

            "selftext": "I tend to agree with many of the forward-thinking viewpoints that are shared on Reddit. However, I feel there is misinformation being circulated regarding the US national debt. The core question that must be answered: What is the national wealth?\n\nPrivate wealth in the US is almost $70 trillion. But dig deeper: What is the mineral wealth in our national parkland? What are the Rocky Mountains, Mendocino County, and ANWR worth? What is the aggregate oil wealth in public lands? What is the value of the US military in the jungle of international relations?\n\nI argue that the $18 Trillion national debt pales in comparison to the national wealth of the United States. There is no better example of this than the revenue generated from Obama's successful energy exploration campaign.\n\nWhen you take a look at the massive swaths of valuable land held by the federal government, it becomes clear that the total federally-owned real estate, oil, minerals, etc. within the borders of the USA could be valued in the quadrillions of dollars.\n\nOne thing has become increasingly clear to me: the United States HAS debt, but it is really not IN debt.\n\nThe purpose of the Federal Reserve is to govern the people through the money supply. The threat of hyperinflation or deflationary depression is exaggerated. The resource wealth of the United States - as well as the large, rich, taxable population - provides a backstop that keeps our currency strong, even in expansionary environments.\n\nI believe this backstop is far more valuable than prior generations' use of precious metal reserves. I concede gold and silver are more tangible, but defining the national wealth by reserves of scarce metals is nothing more than a form of social brainwashing intended to keep resource-rich Americans feeling poor.\n\nConspiracy theorists and John Birchers who measure the national debt against gold reserves are engaging in monetary child's play. However, the Federal Reserve's ability to spend the past decade in crisis while hiding the money supply (M3) from the American public is brilliant. A brilliant scam that must come to an end in the United States, as it has in central banks throughout Europe and across the globe.\n\nThe strength of the dollar in FOREX markets in the wake of QE3 invalidates many conspiracy theories. As a market student and participant, I believe the dollar is legitimately strong and would remain strong through QE4, QE5, and QE6.\n\nIs it time to end the myth of false scarcity? Is the easy answer - a dramatic increase in the debt ceiling to fund the Small Business Administration, Farm Service Agency, and regional banks - the best path for the US economy?\n\nRecently an interesting statistic was released. The USA has fewer corporations today than 40 years ago, despite having three times as many citizens. If \"corporations are people,\" do we just need more \"people?\"\n\nOr is a multi-decade Japanese-style depression a better way to break the will of American men, break the daughters of the revolution into prostitution, seize American's weapons, and ultimately rejoin the British Crown and join the New/Old World Order?\n\nI ask that question only half-sarcastically, because that appears to be the the intent of the current world order, and the path the Untied States is headed. Especially if either Hillary \"Forester de Rothschild-RHODam\" Clinton, or Jeb \"Lehman is now Barclays\" Bush are elected president.\nThis is serious business.\n\nSure, a new monetary system would be nice. But is a total revolution possible? Perhaps it is time to submit to reality, and finally admit that Reagan was right.\n\nMine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of a new hashtag.",

            "selftext": "A keyboard for laptops and computers, where the buttons can change according to which settings you choose or which apps/programs you're using.\n\nBasically since I use maths a lot in my studies, I found myself longing for a more intuitive way to use my laptop as a calculator, instead of having to use my mouse to point and click on some UI or having to carry around an actual calculator.\n\nEven calculator programs that use typing, where for example you have to type \"*\" instead of \"x\" for multiplication, can be slightly awkward.\nThe idea I came up with was that of a keyboard, whose keys display and perform the actions that are available on scientific calculators in exactly the same way, just with a slightly different layout. \n\nSince having a changing keyboard is the main point behind this, the idea grew to something bigger where, like for keyboards on a touchscreen phone, the keyboard can change according to most things you'd want to do on a laptop.\nIn different countries most keyboards have the same layout, just different letters. Also some people partition their hard drives to use both Windows 8 and OS X Yosemite for example, and things like the home or command keys won't both be on a standard keyboard.\n\nThe keys could be made using technology like the E Ink in kindles. The option of lighting could also exist as it does for kindles. They wouldn't have to be touchscreen, but visibility in bright light is obviously important.\n\nI'm not sure of the engineering difficulties in creating something like this, or whether or not the materials used in the technologies is sturdy enough for use as a keyboard key. However, I think a keyboard that's dynamic in this way would be awesome to have. \n\nIf there are any \"obvious\" major issues that would come with such a keyboard, let me know.\n\n\nTL;DR: Computer keyboard, physically similar to standard ones, but where the symbols on the keys can change to fit your needs",

In my head, it works great. Have a network with billions of medical records in it, plug it into a couple IBM Watsons to analyze the data, and doctors around the world can get faster diagnoses, add new patients to the database, etc.\n\nPeople do tend to worry about privacy, though, so names would be left out of the database. But every other identifier would be left in because they're relevant to certain medical conditions. Places you've lived, places you've traveled to, age, sex, gender, ethnic background, spouses/partners, children, all that jazz. And of course, the other relevant medical info: diseases or conditions (both physical and mental), weight, diet, blood type, and everything else you normally get tested or checked out at the doctor's office. \n\nI do think this could help millions of people every year. Heck, we can also throw holistic methods into the mix as last resorts (we have the \"Right to Try\" experimental drugs here in the States already). \n\nNow, whether or not this would work, I'm not sure. But as long as doctors continue to use good judgement, I certainly don't think it could hurt. ",

This probably could generate a bit of wind, especially at highway speeds. So long as the net pressure of the tire does not change, it shouldn't deflate any more than usual and the actual mechanism could likely be built in such a way that it does not affect car performance. Someone with more of an engineering background would have to tell me if this was possible, anyone know a good sub where I can ask?

            "selftext": "A game like Scribblenauts but a MMO where your faction tries to take over the entire canvas. \n\nWhen you start, you get either a pen, pencil, or a paintbrush. Everything you can make costs material, either graphite , paint, or ink and how much depends on how awesome it is. More later, but Destroying the thing gives back what it was made of, and so does eroding a tool until its destroyed. Ink / paint/ graphite cannot be converted directly but can be done creatively. Draw an inkwell, paint bucket, or pencil and it costs a little material but does the job. \n\nXP trains your skill at the tool you used, but NOT health or speed or strength. You must use your imagination to upgrade your stats and avatar. ( Customizing your look is done by drawing wigs, colored clothes, gender swap potions, etc. Adjectives can't directly affect you other than that tho, no Invincible potion. ) \n\nCost of objects varies. XP and usefulness of the thing affects it, but choosing powerful sentient things is not as expensive as you can guess, because both sides have to deal with collateral damage. For example, don't just summon Cthulhu, he's going to smash your enemy AND you. And Heroic beings like knights will defend both you and your foe. This is why awesome tools will be more expensive than awesome characters. \n\nHow to make it interesting: some servers are creative mode and use exactly what is written, but Survival servers will use randomness. Occasional spawning of both monsters and heroes, and extra adjectives on unspecific things ( that aren't labelled ordinary). \n\nNow for the actual MMO part: kinda like Ingress, you want to recolor and defend Flags that are scattered everywhere, and while you could just summon one, dying flags specifically costs several players' material budgets for a few days if they made one from scratch. On Survival servers, it costs more, to balance the random income of ink and whatnot.",

Still colourful, and still harmless, but less of the patronising cartoon characters and tight spaces.\n\nMy ideas are as follows:\n\n#Guns\n\nMuch like a nerf gun, it is harmless. It would fire small sponge balls and are entire portable. The balls are the size of a fist and the guns are held much like a shotgun/rifle. The balls would often be littered all over the complex, but there will be 'ammo' deposits every so often.\n\n#Hall of Mirrors\n\nYou know how kids have those bendy mirrors that warp how you look? And you know those trippy mirror-mazes that take forever to navigate? Combine the two and you get this beautiful specimen. A mirror-maze that warps you, adding to the confusion.\n\n#The Big Ball Pit\n\nFifteen square metres wide. A slow gradient to the five meter deep 'deep-end'. Obviously no edges for people to dive off.\n\n#The Underground\n\nAn underground area for easy mobility across the entire complex through a system of tunnels.\n\n#The Zones\n\nThe complex would be split into a few different zones.\n\n- The War Zone\n\nGattling Guns, Battle Stick (Those poles with soft ends on them) Arena, two warring faction bases, trenches etc.\n\n- The Fitness Zone\n\nObstacle courses, races, slow treadmills, 'fun' gym equipment, wall climbing, trampolines etc.\n\n- The Chillout Zone\n\nA smaller and shallower ball pit, a cushioned area, hammocks etc.\n\n- The Wacky Zone\n\nSlides, swings, the Hall of Mirrors, The Big Ball Pit etc.\n\n---\n\nWould you pay to come here? We would of course host parties where we would set up different games (Find the item, tag, complex-wide war, possibly paintball etc.)\n\nAnd how much would you pay for a two hour slot or a whole-day party?\n\n---\n\nI would also like to here your suggestions!",

Obviously the main limitation with this technique is that for light to shine on the liquid, the liquid needs to already be out of the pool. My idea is almost the same. Having a pool of liquid, and solidifying desired shapes within that pool using radiation.\n\nRadiation is currently used to treat cancer cells, and can be very precise, down to the size of a cell if I remember correctly. The idea is that you either focus a beam to a certain spot, or have to beams meet at the same spot. The radiation normally passes through matter, but when concentrated enough, it releases its energy.\n\nThe technology for this is widely used in treating cancer, the only develpment needed would be finding a liquid that can solidify and become sturdy enough when hit with the radiation.\n\nConsidering the cost of this cancer treatment, I don't think it's very realistic that this will exist anytime soon, but what do you think?",

This ensures that it flushes when you leave the stall, and not before.\n* For small loads which don't require sitting down, it might also trigger a flush after the door sensor has been triggered several times in a row without the toilet sensor triggering (i.e. a few people have tinkled and not manually flushed).\n\nAnother simple solution for urinals which don't have stalls: use light/laser/sonar/pressure sensors at floor level to detect the presence of feet in front of the toilet. Flush after several seconds of detecting feet followed by a few seconds of not detecting feet.",

            "selftext": "So - I had this thought while in the shower. I thought of posting it to /r/showerthoughts for the exposure but really its more suited to this sub. \n\nKickstarter has been a great method for independent producers to get the funding to start a project. I love it and I like being able to back cool ideas and I like the idea that any project I want to start can be backed by any interested parties.\n\nOne of the bigger growing spheres for this site is software development, but it has a few caveats for software development that make a bit troublesome for both parties. \n\nThere's two big ones that I think could be addressed if the system worked differently. I had this idea that what if instead of more people = more money for the developer, more people = less money spent per person. A project should only cost so much to get off the ground, right?\n\nFirst, there's little assurance for backers that a developer will deliver on their promised product by their proposed deadlines. As such kickstarter has started to get this rep about \"scam\" developers who only want to raise funds with great marketing material, grab the money and run. Some people get quite upset when a developer super pushes their deadlines into the next year and want their money back but can't get it. Basically, if you've backed a project, and it reaches it's goal, you've been parted with your money and you must trust a stranger online. \n\nSecondly, it's very difficult for developers to get their project really widely viewed. The projects that tend to get kickstarted quickly are the ones who get picked up by a major news source, it makes a splash with viewers, and a percentage go on to contribute. We know the best method of marketing is word of mouth, but many backers don't talk about the projects their backing because they feel not everyone they know will be interested in the project that they are backing. I feel like this can be improved upon. \n\nSo Kickstarter's current model involves setting different tiers of contributions and the possibility for stretch goals which all help the money flow towards the developer, and then just hand it to them once they've hit the goals and hit the deadline. As well, anyone who has done a Kickstarter can tell you that the funding income rates are a very stressful ordeal, where if you don't meet 50% a certain amount by about 30% till the proposal deadline, you might not get your project funded. Income tends to come in hot at first, then drops, and only picks up a little bit towards the deadline. This last little bit tends to be from all the people who've funded before and either contribute a little bit more or finally get their friends and family involved to make sure the project actually goes through. This is not ideal.  What I propose is a simpler system that should also be more fair to both sides of the coin.\n\nThe developer proposes a set contribution amount and a dollar amount to hit and a deadline to deliver it by. For example, say I'm an indie-game-dev and I'd like to make a game to sell for $5 and I know I'd need about $60,000 and a year to make it. \n\nNext, I create my marketing material and put it up for proposal/acceptance/bidding, or whatever you want to call it. This will be the period of heavy marketing for the developer to try and get as many people on board as possible. Once he has hit the mark, in this instance the 60k, (or 12,000 backers) then he can confidently start working on his project. However, unlike kickstarter, they do not receive the money just yet. Instead, this is where things get interesting:\n\nThe developer does not receive any more funds from more contributions; instead, more contributors means *splitting* the cost amongst the contributors. Essentially all additional money gets put into a refund pool which will then be given back to all of the contributors at the end of a successful deadline. In other works, if the developer gets 24,000 backers instead of 12,000 backers, instead of everyone contributing $5, they end up only spending $2.50. And if the project can go viral, say a million backers, then everyone included has only contributed 6 cents. \n\nThat's the core idea that will allow the actual marketing to take off; suddenly, those backing a project have increased incentive to tell others about the project they are backing. If I want to see video game X come to light, and I can convince other people to also back the project, it'll be cheaper for me in the long run, and them too.\n\nObvious immediate issue is that developers need the money to start their dream project, but this puts a little emphasis on them to cover their base costs going into a project. They need to have raised the capital themselves to get started, but suddenly its no longer a \"I quit my dayjob and risked it all on my dream\" scenario - now it's a \"I quit my dayjob after saving up for a bit with comfortable assurance I'd receive the money I asked for after delivering my product.\"\n\nThe other item is that developers might feel like they deserve more money for more sales; but that is the cost of the comfortable assurance of many backers - You can always sell your product at whatever price you want before, during, after the deadline/launch. This system is designed to get you a lot of backers quickly; and is a little more honest than the typical capitalist system.\n\nNow, how to handle the money:\nIf a project is not fully backed by the time it reaches 25% towards it's proposed deadline, then a refund is issued to the backers, and the project is considered cancelled. \n\nIf a project becomes fully backed, it then enters a \"pending customer approval state\". Backers can now log in at set their approval to Satisfied, Dissatisfied, or pending. At this point, the developer is NOW obligated to deliver something well before their proposed deadline. If the developer can gain a 70%-75% approval rate (still debating what number is fair here) - THEN they will receive the funds. If the developer does not get to that approval rate before the deadline, the money is refunded to the backers. Special notifications are sent out before the deadline reminding people to set their approval state before the deadline hits. Those who are still set to \"Pending\" by the time the deadline hits have their votes discarded. Only those who say they are satisfied or satisfied are counted. \n\nIt should encourage developers to getting SOMETHING released a week or two before their project deadline. Those who want a better chance at success will have more regular releases and transparency to try and get their approval rating up well before the deadline. I think this system should weed out the good guys from the bad, and keep the money and funding in a more equal and fair environment, and encourages both sides to be more realistic about what they set for deadlines, backing amounts, and expectations. Once again, this is really more software oriented - but I think it's the biggest niche of the Kickstarter site and probably the one that gets the most flak for it's issues. Now that it's shown middle-men-funding sites can be successful - and other sites like subable, patreon, and indiegogo show that crowdfunding models WORK, we just need to sort out one that works BETTER for this kind of issue. This is my proposed solution.\n\nThoughts? Comments? Feedback? Obviously there are going to be issues/exploits in this method just as there are with others, but I'd like to hear how viable everyone thinks this might be!\n\n**TL;DR**: Split-Jumper would be like Kickstarter where more contributors = splitting the cost among backers rather than simply giving more money to developers. Encourages word of mouth from backers, is \"fairer\" with the money, and encourages more realistic expectations. ",

The more desirable the DLC, the more I will want to work out.   \n\nSo I was thinking you buy your game, and devs design special DLC that could be redeemed for workout points. So like every 100 workouts completed you get about $10 worth of points or something. Which can be used for guns/gear, maps, etc.",

            "selftext": "If I could make it I'd put it on every platform. And there are three major features that would make this one work smarter. \n\n1. Grammar and intelligent word choice. \nThe concept is an autocorrector that instead of having a list of words, it has a list of nouns, locations, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, prepositions, determiners, etc. Teach it *contextual* corrections and grammar, and only replace with words from dictionaries that make *sense* in context. It'd have to use templates with optional words, and know that some words have unique rules. Templates could be built this way, and work well if the programmer knows what he's doing.  For example, \"[Determiner?] [Adjective?] [Noun] [Conjunction+Noun?] [Verb] [Adjective? + Noun?] [Adverb?]\" could be a common statement template. And if the first word is a question, autocorrect the last punctuation to a '?'. \n\nEdit: apparently the good Autocorrectors already do this? Then new idea: Ask the user what word class new words are. \n\n2. Assume \"wrong button\" instead of \"don't know how to spell\". \nIf there are spelling errors, assume that I hit a button next to the out of place one. Find what words can be spelled with letters near the ones pressed, that should work well enough right? Of course, an option to assume the user really *can't* spell right could be available too.\n\n3. Anagrams. these are when someone types teh letters in the worng order liek this. Should be simple for a computer to see, right? If a word looks wrong shuffle the letters until it finds a word that's one swap from the input, then ask for corrections.\n\n\nWith these concepts, I bet we could avoid weird corrections. I've gotten one too many \"meet me at the octopus\", something needs to change about it.",

Well...\n\nThey earn the big bucks, they enjoy the good life (out of the pockets of tax payers) and we trust them with our present and future. But if you ask anyone in the street \"do you trust politicians?\" the answer is often \"No.\" and the reason for this is that it is stereotypical that a politician that runs for any kind of position will promise all sorts of things and then once in position will not deliver on said promises. This is common enough. It's not just anecdotal, look at various politicians such as [Tony Abbott](https://youtu.be/ShxmO4C6m0M) and [Bill Clinton](https://youtu.be/VBe_guezGGc). These are not an isolated cases and yes, I have picked out the easier cases but they highlight the ideal better. Public servants are meant to serve the public.\n\nThe argument:\n\nIf they told the truth and always do, then what is the problem? \n\nOR\n\nCan we legislate politicians to be more truthful?\n\nThe public would know who they want to vote for (paralleled by the packaging laws on foods. They must display what ingredients and where they came from, how they were grown and they mineral breakdown of the contents and the all important use by date) but instead, lobby groups and misleading information and constant fallacies are thrown around to confuse the public in a unfair popularity contest. Why is the onus completely on the individual to find out which group would be best for them? If there are any laws or regulations protecting the \"consumer/vote\" then they may need reforming.\n\nEDIT: This probably belongs in [/r/ask philosophy](http://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/)",

            "selftext": "**Premise:** Mathematics developed throughout human history in response to the needs of the environment.  Early shepherds used rocks to count sheep, and merchants used writing to manage inventory.  Hence, early number theory emerged.\n\nLater, people learned and studied spatial relationships (geometry), which was relevant to architecture, land management, and navigation.  \n\nDuring the industrial revolution, people were studying the act of reasoning itself (to see if it could be machine-automated) and developing mathematical and logical systems to represent it.  Then people started studying the mathematics of different logical systems--math attempting to validate itself mathematically.\n\nThe point is, mathematics has gone through an organic development that has started simply and built upon itself in response to environmental demands.\n\n**Idea:** Theoretically, shouldn't we recreate these environments for young students, and create the need for them to discover mathematics for themselves?  Rather than teachers hammering rote memorization and arbitrary facts into students' minds, let young children have free play in environments that mimic the ones that originally spurred mathematical discovery.  Create circumstances that elicit a need for the child to 'invent' mathematics for themselves (with the subtle guidance and suggestion of a teacher, of course).\n\nFor example, teachers would let students manage their own toy blocks, and have quantities be relevant somehow.  Encourage *fair* trade amongst classmates.  In encouraging equal trade, a student might see the need for 'numbers' or some way to manage quantities.  Especially if he is given more blocks to start with than he can afford to count anew each time a 'transaction' takes place.  This creates demand for a number system, which the child will recognize organically.  A teacher who is suitably professional should be able to identify when a child grasps this need, and is thus in their most receptive state to learn it.  \n\nFrom there, create an environment that encourages them to start manipulating numbers as a substitute for manipulating blocks directly, thus discovering arithmetic for themselves.  It would obviously be harder to do this with advanced math, but not impossible.  The same idea could be done with physics--let students study flames and such (danger issues would have to be addressed obviously), and introduce formal thermodynamics slowly from there, only when they are now intrigued by their own personal observations of heat, conductance and such, and are most curious and receptive to answers.\n\n**Final Thoughts:** Have you heard the quote \"ontology recapitulates phylogeny\"?  I think it's a good analogy for this idea of organic math education.  It's false, but the idea is that every fetus passes through phases of development that mirror its evolutionary past.  Analogously, math education would move from paradigm to paradigm, creating environments in the classroom that reflect the original circumstances of the major milestones in mathematics.\n\nHas this been done?  I know it's not scalable unfortunately, but maybe some private institutions have tried this?  Is this idea already well-studied?  I'm sure it's not totally original, so any feedback would be appreciated, thanks.",

            "selftext": "The current copyright model as applied to digital media is a complete joke. It feels unfair and burdensome to the user, enforcement is both slipshod and draconian, and the only people making money are lawyers and piracy bounty hunters. \n\nThe thing is, a large percentage of people would be entirely willing to pay for all their digital media usage, if the above flaws were corrected. \n\nIn addition, pirating media (and paying for VPNs and other crap) is also burdensome. People have to take pains to obtain the files without getting caught, they have to deal with large amounts of file storage and backups and indexing... it's all a hassle, and often an expensive one. \n\nAnd the thing is, it forces people into an old and outdated concept of media that nobody even wants any more.\n\nRemember back in the 90s when you'd find a collection of amusing pictures or text files on the interwebs, *and then download them all* to peruse later? Remember when you used to keep a vast library of bookmarks in your browser? Those big fragile collections of carefully-saved things you faithfully back up? When was the last time you did that? When was the last time you looked at any of the stuff you squirreled away? \n\nNot in living memory, I'm guessing. It's offline, it's static, it's not googleable, it's not on reddit, you can't get to it from your phone or at work; it's dead, Jim. \n\nSo how about a radical new approach where *everybody wins*?\n\nEnter Tipjar - a profile-and-licensing service for media content that can actually compete with free, to the point that people would actively *want* to use it. \n\nTipjar isn't a streaming or download service. It's not a content provider. It's a content authorization and fee-distribution service.\n\nThe end user pays a flat subscription fee, as they might for any subscription service. In return, Tipjar pays a pro-rata percentage of that fee to both the creators and the providers of content that the user consumes. \n\nIf a user consumes only one creator's content during a given billing cycle, then that creator receives 100% of the content-creator share of the user's subscription fee. \n\nIf a user consumes content from several different creators, then each creator gets a cut of that share, proportional to their share of the user's total consumption. \n\nContent providers (eg individual streaming/download services) are similarly paid their cut of the content-provider share, according to the percentage of the user's consumption via their service.\n\nIn return, creators license providers to serve content to authorized users without further restriction.\n\nThere are many hooks here:\n\n* A flat-fee model means that there's no cost to the user at point of service; they will therefore have no motivation to avoid the authorization mechanism.\n\n* Giving users passive control over the distribution of their fees gives the user a sense of empowerment; they 'vote with their ears'  to reward both their favourite creators and providers for an enjoyable experience. Consider the rampant success of crowdfunding campaigns such as Kickstarter and Indiegogo; users *want* to throw their money at things they like. \n\n* Recasting the payment model as a sharing-out of *tips* makes payment into a positive experience for the user, and there is a strong pre-existing social stigma against non-tippers. This stigma is a lot stronger than the clearly failed attempt to stigmatize 'theft' of a non-depleting resource, commonly parodied as \"You wouldn't download a car...\" \n\n* In this model, multiple consumers of a single media item (eg groups of people watching a single movie or listening to a music playlist at a party, etc) would have a *positive* motivation to *all* contribute their tips. It costs them nothing to do so, therefore not paying the piper (so to speak) would be considered decidedly antisocial. \n\n* By registering their consumption of media, recommendations (and possibly social-media integration) by content providers could be constantly improved, further motivating users to register in group situations. Making this effortless to the user (for instance, via a bluetooth-enabled phone app) would further lower barriers to participation.\n\nWith this system, content providers will actually compete to give users the *best possible* experience. No ads, no arbitrary restrictions, no copyright warnings, no bullshit - because every time the user chooses them over someone else (or over static downloads), it's money in their pocket.\n\nInstead of the RIAA, MPAA, etc having an adversarial relationship with the public, they could go back to being *everybody's friend*. Instead of having to spend vast resources implementing draconian DRM at every level  constantly monitoring bittorrent, wrangling with the legal system, etc, they could go back to their core purpose of advocating for and aiding in the promotion of content creators.\n\nCreators would actually *welcome* nonstandard distribution channels such as bittorrent, as they'd continue to get paid no matter how the content is delivered.\n\n(I'm not certain where provider-credit should go for downloaded media - something both fair and appropriately-motivating can doubtless be worked out, though.)\n\nAccount-sharing could be discouraged by simultaneous-use restrictions, and by people not wanting their profile messed up, and granting seamless access to a diverse array of media and providers would be a strong motivation to 'pay once and not have to think about it'. \n\nThe system could even be extended to novel uses such as tipping live performers via social media check-in or some wireless device run by the performer, or to value-add services such as freelance DJs offering virtual services to party streams, etc. \n\nThe reward-empowerment hook would also strongly motivate users to report false claims by rogue providers, and other abuses of the system. \n\nThe only people to lose out here are the copyright-extortion companies - and I don't think anyone will mind seeing the back of them.\n\n*Everybody* else wins, bigtime. \n\nSomebody do this, please.

Especially being an international customer ~~(There are ways people)~~, returns are a pain in the butt.\n\nBut what if the company already has a copy of your feet? What if they could send out some type of mold (I was thinking like a clay that hardens and forms a mold or something somehow) to your house, you put your footsies in and send it back. The company then sends the mold through a digital scanner and viola! they have your feet's exact measurement! Maybe they can even show you a digital version of how the shoe is going to look on **your own feet**!!!  *Squeels!!!*\n\nNo but seriously, I'd pay money to know whether or not shoes were gonna fit beforehand. Different designers always differ in size and if they can digitally scan my feet they could scan the shoes also which tells them if my feet were gonna fit or not right? ~~The computers will figure it out~~\n\nIdk but someone please get on this and I'll love you forever.\n",

A pecan tree can produce 50-600 pounds of nut per year.      \n           \nNeighborhoods could organize together to grow a variety of fruit trees so that they have more options to eat, more nutrition, and so they won't end up losing all of their trees to just one disease or bug.       \n          \nThis could also be a highly social activity. You could meet up with your neighbors to trade fruits and the seeds of your best trees (some people may grow as many as 5 or something)      \n                \nFruit trees may require more water than most trees. Why not use the ones that are the most water efficient whilst cutting down enough non-fruit bearing trees and killing enough grass to make the water levels break even? Besides, a comparable amount of water would be used up somewhere on some farm to produce the same fruit.            \n               \nThis would allow farmers to focus their attention on things that we can't do in our front yard. This would lower our environmental impact. This could potentially make us slightly more resistant to famine.

            "selftext": "I go to college, and live in a dorm with a built-in dining hall, and in theory it is designed to encourage socializing among the students.  However, I have found that most people tend to stick to certain cliques, and it is difficult to initiate conversations with random people.  (I have no trouble with this in general, but the school is competitive so the students tend to give off the impression that they don't have time to talk to random people.  And once that's the norm, it's hard to change.)\n\nSo I thought, all the students in the dorm should play a game that gets them interested in learning about each other, and it would be especially good if the game gave people an easy excuse to approach random people that they have never met.\n\nThe game might work like this.  At the start of the semester, everybody writes 5, paragraph-long stories about a part of their lives, kinda like a story you might read on an AskReddit thread.  Then, after screening, those stories are randomly distributed among the other students in the dorm, leaving out the author.  The students then must try to figure out who wrote the story they received.  They get a few weeks to figure that story out, then it's on to the next story, until you run through them all.  There could be some random reward for the person who figured out the authors of the most stories. It would be something of a wild-goose chase, but that would be the fun.\n\nFor example, if you received a little story about a person getting injured in a baseball game, you would scour through the dining hall and be like \"Which one of these guys used to play baseball?\"  You wouldn't want to be obnoxious, but it would probably be somewhat acceptable to walk up to a random guy and be like \"Hey did you used to play baseball?\"  And then even if they weren't the author of the story, a conversation might take off anyways.\n\nI think this game could serve as an excellent way for a group of people to get to know each other better, especially when there are social barriers.  Do you see any issues with this idea?  Can you envision other social settings in which it might be fun to play?",

It is already widely grown in US.  It could reduce our need for Saudi Arabian oil.\n\nThe radioactive polonium could power a nuclear plant.  When all the chemicals are extracted, the leftover cellulose fibers can be pulped into paper.  \n\nI believe every plant was put on this earth for a reason.  ",

You turn on a channel and Netflix has its content on auto stream. \n\nIt's better than TV because Netflix content is more interesting and because there could be multiple channels...
