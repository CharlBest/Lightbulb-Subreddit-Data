Sure, constantly staying with it is a good thing which is why you get more lingots for streaks. Sometimes, though, life gets overwhelming and it slips. Then you've slipped for a couple days and you're trying to get remotivated. So you do a day, but now you have to redo so many sets to rebuild the meter that it gets overwhelming. So you stop again. \n\nAnd don't return. \n\nMonths later you could come back but there aren't any lingots to reward you for overcoming the inertia of not doing it. Think of it like the \"comeback reward\" for online shooters where you die a bunch of times and finally get a kill. At some point you could just rage quit, but you might just stay for that point. And that makes you feel like you've made a step in the right direction. ",

            "selftext": "Password hacks generally churn through systematically testing every password it can make up to see if it can use one to get in. If they do this in some order we can use this! \n\n1. Upon account creation, autogenerate a few Trap Passwords (Trapwords, anyone?) that the user never sees. A few should be near the beginning in alphabetical order, and a few near the end. And all are shorter than the real thing, but varying length. For added security let's put two traps near the real thing (as in nearby when alphabetized but still different enough to be hard to type on accident). Some of these traps need to be common passwords. The system should check if the trap matches the real password and rerolls if it *does* match.\n\n2. Bot comes along and generates a bunch of passwords. It's more likely to discover a trapword than the real password due to statistics and strategy. \n\n3. Upon receiving a trapword the server can do a few things. I like the idea of emailing the user and distracting the hacker by feeding him fake generated data. Or we could just do the obligatory YOU JUST ACTIVATED MY TRAP CARD. I would suggest to ban the IP address but I forgot about proxies. I dunno, I have no idea what happens next, I mean, the user's password is still secret so all we can say is that someone's trying to hack them. 12 year old me would say to throw a virus at them but now we're just getting messy.\n\nI don't intend for this to be the only security measure, *especially* not to replace the idea of just locking up when the user fails to provide the right password after a few tries. This is a backup plan. A wall is a good defense, an entire trap-laden castle with a lava moat, spike pits, crushers, and Sentry Turrets everywhere is a great defense.",

I don't know if you would ask for an email address to cut down on multiple posts or not, I think that might take away from a lot of people filling it out.\n\n  At first I was just thinking a zip code.\n\n  If you were to require any other information the top priorities would have to be that you never email them anything unless they requested something like the results from their area or something like that. As well as never sell any information about anyone who participates. \n\n\n  It would have to be all voluntarily done and could be used just as interesting to look at but I think it could possibly provide a small hint towards places to look into and make sure there's no corruption going on. It would in no way be evidence that would stand up in court, but it may get people to start looking closer at things and it may discourage/hinder people (in some small way) from corrupting elections.\n\n  I understand there would be plenty of room for errors in the numbers, at the same time I don't think that many people are going to put the effort in to filling out a form about voting issues for a laugh. I also realize most people who vote wouldn't fill this out. \n\nLet the bashing begin.\n\n\n  P.S. you could also have it optional for people to put age, occupation, felon, how strongly they feel about the topic they voted on, etc.\n \n  Allowing people under 18 to vote would also be interesting to see what the younger generations ideas are on the issues.\n\nEdit: changed would to wouldn't.",

This makes someone stealing your phone a breeze, Obviously you lost your phone but the button will protect your data so that they can't get any valuable information out of your phone and it could even go asfar as tracking the mobile and taking pictures every 30 seconds and using the microphone to see what they look like and what they sound like.

Keep it flowing and get ready to compensate all its victims, which won't stop, until it's no longer profitable to run, at which point there's no money to compensate them with.  \nI'm sure people are thinking about this, but it seems like we need some kind of \"consented upload\" facility with respect to personal images.  \nWe can detect images of people, nothing gets uploaded until everyone in the picture agrees to upload.  \nBut how can that work?  \nHow can we differentiate between uploading 'public domain' images - something from the news, vs. a photograph of a group of friends windsurfing on holiday in mexico, when one of them is on disability benefit. \nOK maybe this is not an idea so much as an attempt to describe the problem.",

My sister said we should go back to the lifestyle of the past, in wich women just stayed home and took care of the house and the family, but I think it's 2016 and people have been fighting for women rights for a while now. Also there are women that don't have children so forcing all of them to stay at home won't work. \nSo I thought maybe, the government (?) should consider maternity leave time as a social responsibility since those babies are out future and should be taken care of. \n\nI wanted to post it here to see the pros and  cons of this idea, tell me why it wouldn't work or what should we do to make it work.

Everything in congress would be ultimately the same, except that the role of \"President\" would be fulfilled by a group.

The robot will use solar energy to generate power for itself and when it\n\nbegins to run low heads to the top for charge then it returns and repeats, an infinate cycle to beat out the\n\nplastic one.\n\nIt will have a GPS installed and constantly send signal to its server so it cannot be lost and automatically\n\nreadjust itself to the current if needed using an inboard engine mounted to its back. Rotating will be commenced\n\nby propellers on the sides top and bottom. it requires a heat camera to avoid organisms and sonar to look for\n\nmaterial objects such as bags. Arms are mounted to the front to drag in these objects where they're stashed and\n\ninapt to leave its compartment as it cuts and crushes them. It has wheels on its bottom next to the propeller\n\nwhich are concealable for if it needs to go on land. the motor is stored inside and runs fully on electric, the\n\ncrushers and compressors do the same.\n\nthanks for reading -- CAKE\n",

            "selftext": "I'm not sure how other countries handle it, but in the US the rate of inflation is managed by the treasury.  This allows for a fairly steady rise in inflation as opposed to sharp jumps that would cause social instability.  \n\nUnfortunately, if your pay rate doesn't go up at the same rate as inflation you're effectively getting paid less (since you're wages are constantly being devalued).  This creates a Red Queen sort of situation, or at least, it makes that year-end bonus seem alot better than it actually is.  \n\nBecause of this, I think that it should be legally required that employers increase their employees wages at the same rate as inflation (which of course includes minimum wage). \n\nEdit: [Here's](http://www.usinflationcalculator.com/) an inflation calculator if anyone is interested.

            "selftext": "So lately I've been struggling with school and it has really put some ideas into my brain about how one could improve schooling for many. \n\nI have A.D.H.D. . A very common disorder upon this generation. This has been a struggle for me since I was diagnosed in the fifth grade. Growing up with this disorder really molded my brain in many ways that normal brains aren't. For example: Instead of having to take one hour of homework time per day to sit down and punch it out, I have to take the entire night after dinner to get what should be one hour of homework done in around 2-3 hours. Now, there are programs in the school I attend to allow students like me with learning issues that give extended time on homework assignments and extra time on tests, but not every problem can simply be solved by giving the student extra time. There are multiple variables that go into improving the learning experience for students like me.\n\nMy idea is that they create 2 separate but parallel lesson plans for the class. Each lesson is the same and the material the student would learn would also be the same, but each would be a different type of learning.\n\nThe first type would be linear thinking such as logic, science, and mathematics. The people who think this way  have a more dominant right side brain. The right side of the brain controls logic, math, etc. The homework would be based upon these themes of learning so that the students with this type of brain may excel. \n\nThe second type is non-linear thinking. This includes hands-on experiences, writing, listening, and physically doing things. People with this type of brain have a dominant left side brain. This side of the brain controls creativity and arts.\n\nThis 2-way parallel way of teaching allows students with all different types of brains to learn the same material and come out just as knowledgable as the other. They're not learning different things, they're just learning it differently.\n\nReply what you think about it!",

            "selftext": " I recently visited a friend who only drinks his coffee black and doesn\u2019t keep milk in his fridge. Right, why are we friends?...what a weirdo. As he met us at the door unloading recently purchased groceries he said, \u201chad to run out and get coffee creamer, I always forget\u201d. \n\n**Problem Statement:**\n\nCurrent calendar apps do not address the \u201cconsumerism\u201d aspect of events. Events often have the added task of needing to purchase something. There does not exist a way to make purchases that are tied with a specific event within your calendar app.\n\n**Proposed Solutions:**\n\nIntegrate within the invite itself the ability to purchase items to either be picked up or delivered in time for the event. Allow invitees to have either \u201cread only\u201d or \u201cedit\u201d access which means they can see the purchases and in some cases, add to the order. There would be a permanent record of the receipt which would also make it easier when it comes time for your friends to ante up or send that receipt to HR for expenses. \n\n**Use Case Examples:**\n\n* Friends are coming over and you need essentials. \n\tChoose delivery or pick/up which will narrow the list of possible providers\u2026 such as Safeway, Amazon, QFC etc. Date is set by the invite itself and order is stored in the invite. \n*\t Family is coming to stay for +1 week and your cousin has allergies to everything\n\tSend out the invite to your family and give them the ability to add to the invite so that Bob\u2019s gluten free rolled oats show up when they arrive!\n*\tYou\u2019ve scheduled a lunch meeting and your colleagues will crucify you if you don\u2019t bring food\n\tHave Jimmy Johns bring in some sammiches\n\nThe use cases are endless. After a brief search of the top calendar apps we have:\n\n1.\tGoogle Calendar\n2.\tApple Calendar\n3.\tMicrosoft Outlook\n\nAll of the above focus on weather (who cares, it is what it is), UI, and smart notifications like traffic. With the addition of purchases, I think it could potentially fill a gap in the functionality of our planning options. I am not remiss in my thinking this is an easy task. \nWhat I\u2019m essentially proposing is a common interface for ordering, well, everything and a way to link that to calendar invites. \n\n**Additional Ideas:**\n\n*\tOption for people to purchase certain items and would essentially \u201ccheck\u201d those off the list\n*\tAssign a purchase to an invitee\n*\tIf the event was cancelled or moved, all previously placed orders would be updated to reflect new date\n*\tOption to keep list private to only event organizer\n*\tWeekly/Monthly/Yearly expense reporting also detailing which provider you used most often\n",

You have to sit and scan, or take a pic, or type it in.\n\nGrocery stores already store your name and rewards points, they are already scan each item... can't they just track and upload your purchases for you as well?  Then recent purchases could be accessed by the app on your phone and it's auto loaded into your fridge's inventory.  Make it so each major chain has an accessable database so everywhere you shop loads into your inventory, not just one store.\n\nYou'd still have to manually remove finished items.  The only way to expidite this would be via phone scanner i.e. scan the empty milk carton before tossing it in the recycle bin.  This could remind people to recycle too! Maybe even track recycling % and waste levels and help the environment.",

So you wouldn't need many batteries. You could even use solar for going long distances slowly.\n\nIt would serve 3 purposes -\n\n1- to function as 4 wheel drive - electric would give you great control. So it would work with the fuel powering the other 2 wheels.\n\n2 - in an emergency if the engine died. It would just be used enough to get you off the trail where you could fix the gas engine. OR You could have a solar panel and it could be used to slowly get you to civilization to repair your engine. Or if you were on the road it could get you to a garage or out of a dangerous situation.\n\n3 - could be used to winch. Imagine how great of a winch a motor that size would be.",

            "selftext": "Here's a simple system of public transportation that would eliminate all waiting at stops, where you can get on and off at any time.  \n\n1. Start with chair lift, of the sort you see at ski resorts.  Put it in a deep tunnel or high in the sky or whatever.  We'll call this \"Chairlift A\". \n2.  Fasten sturdy wooden planks between the chairs, then remove the chair backs.  Now you have a walkway-lift instead of a chairlift.\n3.  On the bottom of the planks, put mount another chairlift.  The chairs should descend slightly more than one human-length below lift Chairlift A.  Repeat steps 1 and 2 to make B a walkway.  \n\n4. Put escalators between A and B.  These escalators should be fixed to A, but have wheels where they rest on B.  \n5. Move Chairlift B faster speed, relative to the ground, than A.  It should be about as fast as possible in which a smooth transition to and from the escalators is possible.  \n   --.|.------.|.----   wheel thing  A is riding on  \n    ==|==|==|==|   Walkway A ->  \n    ------.|.------.|.    wheel thing attached to A ->  \n    ==|==|==|==|   Walkway B ->->  \n\n6.  Repeat steps 1-5  for as many levels as is necessary to reach the desired speed.  Passengers can now enter any time they want on A, then use the escalators to go down to a faster B, even faster C, and so on to whatever speed they wish to travel.  \n7. (optional) There are a lot of ways to increase the smoothness of transitions and reduce the lift depth.  For example, the passengers could be in shopping carts or the like, and have ramps between the levels.  Going down the ramp could provide maybe 15 mph acceleration between the levels.  For going up, there would be bungee cords dangling from Chairlift A, that the passengers could grab.  The bungee cords would absorb the shock of the transition but allow the passengers to hold on as the go up the ramp (note: the down ramps would be fixed to A, the up ramps would be fixed to B so the ropes would pull you up, so they cannot be parallel).  Note that this may reduce the safety of the system.  \n\n**tl;dr: Put a chairlift on a chairlift so you can ride while you ride.**",

            "selftext": "In America, our elections are held using a slightly modified version of a system called First Past The Post (you can find some good videos if you go looking).  Basically, a bunch of parties submit candidates and who ever gets the majority vote wins.  America has the electoral college as a second layer and it's actually whoever wins the majority of electoral college votes who wins, not individual members of the population. This system ultimately ends in two major political parities (that inevitably have a tremendous amount of political clout).  \n\nApproval voting allows people to vote for all the candidates that they believe could do the job.  It could be one, or it could be all of them.  Who ever gets the highest approval in the form of the most votes wins.  In this system candidates aren't fighting against eachother for vote so much as their fighting for the broadest appeal (or approval).  A secondary run off would be necessary if no candidate received a majority approval and would likely be between the top two contenders.\n\nRank choice voting is a modification of approval voting that eliminates the need for a secondary run-off.  In rank choice voting people select all the people who they think could do the job and rank them as first choice, second choice, and so on.  After all the ballots are cast the first choice votes for the lowest approval candidate are distributed to those voters second choice candidate, and so on and so forth until a candidate reaches a majority.  \n\nIn America we've been choosing between the lesser of two evils for too long and need to change and stop the madness (and divisiveness).  \n\nRemember, states have the right to hold elections as they see fit under the constitution.  So any state could pass an amendment to modify it's voting system. ",

Happily we do know the melodies of Bible-readings - and Bible-reading change (with the  dominant melody) each week. (Mainly in synagogues but it is followed in a few Christian Gnostic-related sects or some Sufi Muslim groups too). It is easy to find the similar melodies in the Operas - so we should start with the Biblical melodies - then search for a parallel melody in an Opera and then look at the historical stress constellation.

They don't affect their bottom line, so they need to deal predominantly with the public perception.  So they create support numbers where nobody ever answers, or there's not really an intent to solve problems.   Their company policies are in complete disregard for the customer.  \n\nIf there were plenty of competitors I'd say that's the American way and we could easily go to a competitor, but it's quickly getting to the point that companies have little or no competition.   When a competitor pops up they quickly squash or buy them.  \n\nI think a union (like in the 1920's with a win at all cost attitude) were formed where complaints could be pushed up through the union and dealt with en-masse.   Also, just by being a member of this union you could get at least a little more influence with companies.  \n\nNote:  I'm not talking about Yelp where there's a bunch of voices yelling different complaints, but rather an organization where the complaints are handled in an organized fashion so there's a single voice getting the biggest complaints addressed.   \n\nAlso, we'll have to find some people who are incorruptible.

Which then brought on a joke in a scene i played in my head. A character driving a car with a passenger.

However, they don't lecture to classrooms, instead they assist students in developing critical thinking skills in understanding MOOCs that students may be taking, in the sense that a classroom of 20 students may be working on 20 different courses in the same field. This is necessary, as the guides cannot possibly have in depth knowledge on every online course available. (Classrooms would more than likely be computer labs, though there could be space for people who own their own computer, and the labs would be reserved for those who cannot afford one).\n\nI feel this will become a reality as schools and universities will eventually move to individualize what students learn, given that they'll be provided with so many more options. I'm unsure how much of the traditional style of education will be dropped, but this feels like a future step. Universities may never grow out of style, because in-person interaction and physically doing things are very important for understanding, like in the worlds of chemistry and physics, where you learn much through experimentation. \n\nMaybe libraries that are failing nowadays could incorporate something like this. \n\nA scatterbrained idea for the moment, but I think it could become clearer through some good ol' fashion internet discussion.",

            "selftext": "Third person view is way more fun in flight sims than cockpit view. The idea is to have a drogue on a tether which can be spooled out behind an airplane in flight. The drogue has a small camera in it, or better yet a couple of them. You'd have to trim the drogue to drift upward a bit too give a slightly top down and from behind view which feeds via a wire into a monitor in the cockpit. It'd mostly be for fun but I think it would also be useful for getting a view of your own aircraft for safety checks mid flight. ",

            "selftext": "I'm sure someone has already thought of this, but I can't find any articles or discussions on it, so maybe someone helps me out here or we can discuss the feasibility of this.\n\nThe idea stems from the fact that so much technology nowadays requires internet access, yet often it's sparse to come across. However, with all the technology around, it could be possible to \"pinball\" your way to the data you want via other people.\n\nFirst of, the obvious drawbacks and roadblocks - it would require everyone to have their networking antenas (Bluetooth, WiFi, LTE and such) turned on all the time. That, in addition to the activity, would take a huge toll on battery lives. Two more problems - device capacity (I'll get to that later) and privacy. Having your device open to literally everyone else's traffic could prove.. problematic.\n\nNow, let's finally get to the concept - let's say you want to read the latest article on your favorite news site but have no connection available to you. Right here, the path branches. Option A - chances are, someone close enough to you, especially if you live in a city, already has read the article and it's in their devices cache memory, so you would either directly connect to them and get it or daisy chain your way to them across multiple devices. Same goes for app updates. Someone nearby probably already has the latest version of Chrome. The Option B would be, in case nobody nearby has what you're looking for, you'd bounce across multiple devices until you found one that provides access directly to the internet and provides the data for you.\n\nThe main advantage I see for this is the distance you could cover. You connect to your farthest yet reachable neighbor, so does he and so on and so on and suddenly, you end up downloading stuff from the open WiFi hotspot on the other end of town. (assuming there are enough people along the way) \n\nI describe the concept with smartphones but it could jump across computers, tablets, routers and access points themselves and whatever other technology that supports wireless data transfer.  \n\nI'm interested in finding out more about why this could or could not work, how it could be improved etc.",

Something catchy that has a little ring to it. \n\n2nd - What type of food should I provide? Just snacks or a meal? Should I make the guests bring an appetizer or drinks?\n\n3rd - What type of games are fun? Drinking games or anything else? \n\nShould I do awards or is that too lame?\n\nThere will be between 10-20 people attending.\n\nAny ideas or suggestions would be MUCH appreciated. ",

Buy one of the hundreds of islands (that are completely uninhabited) in northern Canada from the Canadian government. (possibly Coats Island because it is rather large and relatively not too cold.)\n\n3. Come to the island with a group of a few hundred settlers devoted to your campaign for sovereignty, and establish a small town on the island made entirely of log cabins put up in a super efficient work-together-ey Amish style. (bring the logs from mainland Canada by boat, and plant trees in the place of the ones you cut down.\n\n4. Develop an economy based on Internet services; basically have a log cabin commune town filled with freelance web developers, game designers, programmers, ect... (because its a service that you can provide without having to export any goods, and without needing a way to travel to the countries you are shipping to)\n\n5. Become the worlds largest exporter of web-based services, grow your town into a city, campaign for google fiber to set up a hotspot in the middle of it so you can be even more efficient.\n\n6. Establish the worlds only truly democratic system of government, having the citizens vote on every issue. Write a constitution, create a name for said country, create a flag and an anthem, have an elaborate system of committees that manage every single aspect of your government. i.e. Department of Integrity would have the job of keeping the balance of power, and making sure that no aspects of the government/police become corrupted.\n\n7. Have a temporary 'Department of Recognition' who's job it is to make your presence known to all other countries, and campaign for international recognition and...\n\nBOOM - Internetlandia Is now a country (the name is a work in progress)\nP.S.

Basically so the computer software (perhaps not perfected until years later) can use the database of their voice sounds to make them say new lines for tv shows and movies long after they're dead.  \n\n**Edit:  But the idea is, get this \"script\" of vocal and inflection ranges recorded now.

            "selftext": "Basically internet scavenger hunt.\n\nGoal of the game is for OP to describe something on the internet that he thinks will be difficult to find. Commenters have to search online for what OP is describing, and the first person to find it wins!\n\n\nOP title: 'Try to find a lesser-known rock ballad song from the 80's that has the lyrics \"creating a love\" in it.' (Or something along those lines)\n\nAnd then OP would link the song in the description with a spoiler tag. Maybe they could also add some additional info to help out the hunters.\n\nThen commenters would use the info given to find whatever OP was thinking of. Perhaps they could ask OP questions to try to narrow down their search criteria.\n\nOf course there are a few rough patches in the idea that will make it hard to implement.\n\n1. The target has to be fair. OP cant just think of some video with 6 views that his buddy just posted. The target must have a certain amount of views/listens, so it can be findable. (2500?)\n\n2. Theres really no way to judge how fairly OP describes the target. There would have to be rules that doesnt allow things like: \"Try to find a techno song by a french guy that has a heavy beat\". Maybe specific things like, lyrics, dates, visuals, vocaroos, will be required for the post to be fair game.\n\n3.There needs to be a way for OP to post a link to the target without being able to change it and without commenters being able to see it unless theyve guessed correctly. This prevents cheaters from just checking through the spoiler tag, and prevents OP from just changing the target if they feel someone is getting close to finding it.\n\n4. There needs to be some kind of incentive for people to want to try and find the target. Perhaps a scoring system for how many posts a user has won. However, some posts will be easier than others and there really isnt an objective way of judging the difficulty of each hunt.\n\n\nThe idea is in a very primitive state, but I want to know what people think about it, or if something like this already exists. Maybe toss some ideas in?",

If X is like me and X derrives great satisfaction from Z, perhaps I might also derive great satisfaction from Z.  \n  \nEstablishing similarity is a central question that I've only begun thinking about, but there appear to be particular metrics by which we can ascribe high levels of similarities between people.  \n\n*Three means of establishing similarity between individuals...*\n\n**Biomatics:**\nFor instance, psychologists can measure personality dimensions through biometrics, for example: disgust, which has been shown to influence one's political outlook. Bodily sensors can measure arousal levels when exposed to certain content intended to induce disgust. This is just one means of establishing meaningful similarities/differences in individuals.\n\n**Objective personal statistics:**  \nObjective facts like age, sex, race, and IQ are variables that can be readily compared.\n\n**Self-Report**\nSelf-reporting is less accurate. People may try to provide \"correct,\" rather than \"accurate\" answers to avoid looking bad.  \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n**An overview for fun:**  \nBy using means such as these, we establish degrees of similarity between individuals and these individuals can compare themselves with their \"doppelgangers\" to get a sense of where a person like me belongs. Under what circumstances he or she would thrive.  \n\nThrough interaction with the app, you can observe the different lives your \"doppelgangers\" are leading and the varying levels of personal satisfaction among them. Emphasis on what professional and personal changes are likely to lead to greater levels of satisfaction for you, and which might actually decrease your satisfaction.\n  \n\n  \n**Example:** Certain women, for instance, may be persuaded by their doppelgangers that they would in fact be happier as a stay at home mom than pursuing a career. Granted, this conclusion relies upon a complicated comparison of several categories of variables, including but not limited to the three described above. Other variables might include *relationship status, economic stability*, and *current profession*.\n  \nGranted, it's a terrifically complicated problem the app is attempting to solve (essentially, the optimization of human happiness), but I suspected that its complexity is proportionate to the level of utility it would provide if properly developed. That is to say, I think cracking this problem could provide enormous utility to the individual and even society at large.  \n  \nHow many of us have asked ourselves whether we might have been happier as a __fill in the blank__? Life is limited and we can only run a limited number of \"simulations\" to determine what we would find fulfilling in life. Observing the lives of similar people is the closest approximation I can think of to the possibility of living one's life over and over again, each with different professional and life choices.  \n  \nA little rambly, sorry about that, but the idea isn't totally crystallized yet. I appreciate any feedback that you might have.",

Maybe partner with a phone manufacturer like BLU or other manufacturer that makes phones that have good stats and low prices, but don't have otterbox cases because of lack of marketshare.  The otterbox could be built in to the phone's design for maximum drop protection.  At least the front of the device could have the raised \"lip\" of 3mm raised plastic around the screen so if the device falls, the screen would be less likely to crack since the raised lip would be a \"bumper\" to the flat screen.  I never understand cases that have no raised lip.  If the phone falls, how is that gonna protect the screen from cracking.

So english word on top and bellow in the next line the same word in other language, always grouped though...\n\n1st line first language, 2nd line second language, 3rd line first language, 4th line second language.. And so on for the whole page, obviously text in different languages would be shorter or longer due to certain words containing more or less characters depending on the language that it is. That is why you would keep the individual words grouped together first language on top second one in other language just underneath in the next line down. I thought of this while brushing up on my french and trying to learn japanese, after getting annoyed at the inefficiency of trying to look up the translation of every word while reading.",

You open a picture of your choosing in this app (i would pick a tasteful nude picture of a woman)\n\n2. You use the various drawing tools to make that nude lady in the picture appear to be covered in chocolate, whip cream, honey, oil or whatever floats your boat really.\n\n3. Once you have made your lady in the picture look good enough to \"eat\" then hit the save button, and hallelujah your done!\n\nFor the drawing tools there can be an option to sample real pictures of chocolate, whip cream, etc, for added realism. The tools can also be designed in a way that changes the thickness and scale of the the spread/smear based on how hard or gently you touch the screen. There can be several different spreading/smearing tools...\n\n(one that mimics the look of spreading/smearing with fingers, can pick the number of fingers as-well, also angle adjustable)\n\n(One that mimics a full hand spread/smear, drawing tool shaped like hand with spread or together fingers, could have it angle adjustable to give further smear variety)\n\n(One that mimics a barefoot spread/smear, drawing tool shaped like a barefoot, also angle adjustable)\n\n(One that mimics a lick, so a drawing tool shaped like a tongue that rather than spread, licks off, could think of it as the eraser of this app. Also angle adjustable and rather than adjustable thickness for this one you could have adjustable licking efficiency, the higher the efficiency the closer to an eraser it is)\n\nIf you have experience with coding apps (which i do not) i would love to collaborate with you and make this one a reality. cheers (:",

Then, youth from the community come to sit in the empty chairs and spend 5 minutes talking to their elderly partner. The older person has a prompt of things they want to say such as things they regret in their life and the things that brought them the most joy. They might mention what they would do if they were young again or places they would go if they had the time. After 5 minutes, the bell rings and the youth get up and move to the next table. When the event is over the youth leave with a different perspective on life and both the elderly and youth leave with a new appreciation for the people in their community. \n\nLet me know what you think!",

It's really annoying that you cant openly discuss new movies and tv episodes on Facebook with your friends and family without ruining it for everyone else.  It's also really annoying when something gets spoiled! So facebook should implement a \"spoiler post\" function. It allows you to post whatever you want and said post will show up on everyone's timeline with the content hidden until you click it.  It wont stop EVERYONE but I think it would be a welcome addition. ",

NASA (and others) tackled this problem by (to vastly over-simplify) running cool water around the outside of the space station and it's walls, then radiating that heat into space. I think. I'm fairly certain, but I'm not really certain. Ok, ok I'll get on with it. What if we used that heated water to generate electricity with a thing called a thermoelectric generator AKA 'TEG' [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermoelectric_generator) We could use this to power either the station or to shoot lasers and do science and stuff! Someone please tell me if this would work, as I have no idea. ",

Skinny, nerdy kid, glasses, but holy shit, his arm is a shrimp claw! He puts his claw in a fish tank, and snaps it. Boom, dead fish. That's a Pistol Shrimp claw. This kid has a freaking pistol shrimp claw! Only thing is, it doesn't work on land, it only works in water. Air is ~800 times less dense than water, which is why it works underwater only. They run some tests. Holy shit, this kid's claw has muscle capacity out the ass. He can train his claw to become stronger, strong enough to compress air like he does with water. So Ivan trains his \"Snap Pressure\" to where he can project pure heat from his claw due to his \"snap.\" So now he can at LEAST stun people with his \"hand cannon.\" Also he's learned to fight melee with the claw, super athletic, almost like he's invented a separate martial art incorporating the claw. His claw is basically a gun, at this point, so he takes on the moniker of \"Colt Smith.\" (Working on it).\n\nLogan, being a dick, just calls him \"Shrimp,\" due to his small stature.\n\nTL;DR: Boy with a Pistol Shrimp claw for an arm. Eventually is able to use it on land. [Insert Superhero Moniker]. Logan's a dick.",

            "selftext": "We have a huge house and three extremely tiny dogs. We open the door to the backyard every few hours so they can pee and poop and we're having a smoke and are talking in the meantime.\n\nSome dogs go inside the house while we're talking so we don't notice, and some are still in the backyard. When we go inside, we call the dogs that we see are still in the backyard and they go inside. \n\nThen when we're inside and are comfortably in the couch, we notice one dog is missing. Turns out it was behind a hedge in the backyard and is still outside, so we have to get up again and go call it. The reverse is also true; sometimes a dog is already inside but we didn't see it go inside and we can't immediately find it inside because it's behind a couch or under the table, and then we search through the backyard for 15 minutes only to find out it isn't there and it was inside all along.\n\nIDEA: It would be awesome to have a system with 3 led lights for each dog. The dog could wear a collar with a sensor in it which the system could use to track whether the dogs are inside or outside. When the dogs are inside, the led of each respective dog is green. When there's still a dog outside, its respective led light is red. Gone are the days of constant worrying about the dogs: green light -> the dog is safe and sound, red light -> the dog is outside in the cold backyard and should be called inside.\n\nThe sensor could either be Bluetooth or Wi-Fi based although Bluetooth would be better cause you can make the light turn green when the dog's collar is connected and red when the system lost contact with the dog's collar (which means he is not inside), or it could be infrared based and make contact with an infrared device located in the door opening that toggles the led lights with each passing of the dogs (going out: red, going inside: green)",

            "selftext": "I think the move for video games being more cinematic in the last decade or so will hurt VR experiences. Life is never actually like a movie, and the usual presentation of video games requires a sense of detachment to work (via certain camera angles and poetic but unrealistic dialogue). VR games should focus more on immersion to really draw people in.\n\nImagine if you were to make a VR game about you and your friends climbing Mount Everest. If you were to make it in the vein of your usual game, there would be Uncharted-esque quick time events and sweeping camera shots sprinkled throughout that ripped you out of the experience of \"being there\" that VR is supposed to deliver. However, if you made the same game without all of that, which completely limited you to your own perspective, and focused on realism of surviving without trying to make you feel like you were in a Michael Bay movie through procedurally generated yet realistic obstacles like storms and wildlife balanced against things like taking shelter and keeping warm, you'd have a much more interesting game. \n\nThoughts?",

            "selftext": "You know that [Scale of the Universe](http://htwins.net/scale2/) interactive videographic?  It'd be really cool if someone made something similar to show where WW2 materials were produced and where they went.  But using moving unit objects like a real time strategy game (like command and conquer).  \n\nAlso show the actual fighting units such as infantry, submarines, aircraft and tanks as they move around.  When something's destroyed or killed it's visual representation 'object/unit' dies in the videographic.  \n\nObviously the entire world is too big for you to see the detail of where tanks, aircraft carriers, and military rations are produced and where they go (all on one screen.  but you can move around and zoom in).  But you could scroll around to areas of interest and see where things are made and where they go.  \n\nYou could hit 'Play' and watch, 'Pause', 'Rewind' and 'Fast Forward'.   You could zoom in and out.  \n\nThey key would be to use nicely animated objects for 'units', such as in a RTS game.  For large items like battleships and aircraft carriers 1 object would represent that 1 ship or unit.  But for, say, infantry divisions, 1 footsoldier could represent however many thousands of men are in a division.  \n\nSame for bullets, bombs, and rations.  Say, 50 tonnes of whatever is represented by 1 'object/unit'.  So leading up to the invasion of France, in Normandy, you'd see huge amounts of stuff flooding into England.  But you'd also see many transport ships being sunk by U-boats.\n\nSome examples, you could see the specific name of the factory and city where Soviet T-34 tanks were being produced.  And then see where the tanks go for battle, and where they're destroyed.  \n\nYou'd see America mobilize to produce the nuclear bombs, and watch as they are transported to Okinawa by the Indianapolis, and then dropped on Japan.  \n\nYou could see America fire up it's massive production capacity and watch aircraft carriers being built, their planes too, and watch them sail around the Pacific fighting the Japanese.  \n\nYou'd also see representative units for infantry divisions, tank divisions, air force squadrons, and submarines.  \n\nYou'd even see where military rations such as K-rations were manufactured, and then where they went.  \n\nI'd personally find such a website/videographic (is that a word? Not sure what to call it) absolutely fascinating, and I'd study it for hours.  \n\nYou could go to extreme detail.  Showing where specific generals and heads of state are.  So when Roosevelt, Churchill and Stalin meet at Yalta, you'll see them traveling there from their respective capitals.  \n\nOne of the greatest points of interest for me would be the battle of Stalingrad.  Watching the massive amounts of men and materials streaming into the city.  \n\nWhat do you think?  Do you think this idea has merit?  Obviously I can't produce it, but I'm sure someone can.  \n",

            "selftext": "Imagine a game similar to Madden or NBA 2K but instead of basing the players on real people, everything is randomly generated. \n\nFrom the names to the individual stats, players are randomly generated when the game is started and everytime a recruiting event comes up. The players develop over time and get better individually, and learn how to play with their team better. \n\nIn franchise mode, the you are given the opportunity to found a team right there or go back 50 or so years and build a team from Day 1 and build a legacy for your team through out the ages. You would get to design a logo and your teams colors/uniforms and choose where the team is based out of. Home Stadiums are customizable as well. The better you perform, the more history your team has and the status/how awesome your stadium is all influences the amount and behevior of your fans. There could also be a business side of the game where you manage merchindise (what you are going to sell), advertisements (which players get featured) and of course negotiating player contracts and salary as well as scandals. You could of course hire a board of directors to balence team revenue and everything mentioned previously\n\nYou must hire a coach (randomly generated) and depending on your playstyle they can do different things. If you just want to run a franchise, you can let them play the games for you and they will make plays and decisions based on their playstyle and individual stats. If you want to call the plays, then you create a coach. Likewise, if you want to be a player, you can create one but everything else will be randomly generated. \n\nThe online multiplayer has many features. One of the main ones is being able to join Leauges with your friends and playing eachother. Radom matches are also an option. \n\nI think this would make an awesome game for android, but a console version would be cool too.\n\n\nI might add more things as ideas come to me, but what do you guys think? Would you buy something like this? Have anything to add? \n\n",

With that in mind a miniseries based on trying to teach people exactly who this 'great dictator' was most have some chance for success. \n\nThe premise of the idea boils down to this; the series is in three parts, focusing on three major elements of foreign policy- the anschluss of Austria, the crisis in Czechoslovakia and finally the Danzig affair. The niche idea here is that in each episode you follow a family living in the area affected, Austrians, Czechs and Polish. To get a domestic viewpoint, alongside this is scenes from the diplomacy of the great powers and their representatives, and with each significant development cutting back to the family in question to see what it has done to affect the situation. This gives character development to the representatives who will be in all three episodes and makes it much less dry by giving it an empathetic domestic attachment. The final episode ends simply with the declaration of war. Seeing no fighting but still plenty of action. \n\nSorry if this is the wrong place to post this, its my first time posting here.

            "selftext": "Years ago I had this crazy idea. Most people I mentioned it to thought it was crazy, of course, but obviously not crazy enough to make it to /r/crazyideas - but maybe it fits /r/lightbulb. I'm not sure, you be the judge.\n\nHere\u2019s how we feed everyone, repair our environment, and provide meaningful work: convert lawns into organic vegetable gardens.\n\nImagine if all the property owners currently pumping water and fertilizer into their grass carpets used our precious natural resources to grow food \u2014 healthy, unprocessed, nutrient-rich vegetables. Imagine if vast swaths of public land currently serving as paved parking lots and grass-covered parks were parcelled out to non-stakeholders for community gardens. Imagine if we used our wealth to feed each other.\n\nAn entire city block in my Hollywood neighborhood is devoted to such a cause. It\u2019s called Wattles Garden. Hundreds of apartment renters in the area are granted a small plot of arable land to grow what they wish. This being Southern California, where the sun shines year-round, residents harvest thousands of pounds of real food derived directly from the ground, steps away from the Star Tour buses cruising Hollywood Boulevard.\n\nAt my homestead, on the other side of the Boulevard, we\u2019ve successfully replaced the grass with gardens, and after only two seasons we\u2019re growing the majority of the food we eat. When we have too much of something \u2014 zucchini, tomatoes, cucumbers \u2014 we donate the excess to neighbors.\n\nThe benefits of growing food instead of grass are many. The drawbacks are\u2026well, none.\n\nFor those too busy with \u201creal\u201d jobs to tend to their broccoli and brussels sprouts, offering plots of land for sharecropping is a fine alternative. Spreading the bounty from a privileged few to a population of many isn\u2019t an inherently bad thing to do, despite what the virulent anti-Socialist rhetoric of the past 80 years has claimed. Try it some time. It feels good.\n\nTending to a garden, even a small one, makes a net positive impact on the world. Maintaining a lawn does not. ",

            "selftext": "Summary: A teaching system which involves firing all of the teachers and replacing them with cheap unskilled classroom monitors, multimedia lessons, and tutors. Multiple companies develop competing lessons for the same small topic (ranging from 1 to 10 classroom hours long). The more successful lessons (based on standardized test results for that topic) will \"survive\" and be taught to a greater percentage of future students, causing the company to be paid accordingly. Strong competition, continued and rapid lesson improvement, unbiased statistical feedback, and equal opportunity are all built into the system, none of which can be said about the current educational system.\n\nPodcast link: https://soundcloud.com/podcastdetroit/creativity-wasted-episode-2\n\nDetailed description: \nMy idea is to have an online-based teaching system of videos and interactive web pages based on competition.  The concept is called \"Teach or Die\" which is similar to the web site \"Funny or Die\" in that the teaching materials that are not successful will be discarded, leaving only the most successful teaching materials. \n\nEach class, such as Algebra 1, will be split into standardized lessons, which will be taught in a standardized period of time, from 1 day to a couple weeks, depending on what is appropriate for the subject matter.  There will be a standardized test for each lesson.  Multiple \"teaching teams\" will develop competing videos and/or interactive web pages for a particular lesson.  These lessons will be shown to a random set of students spanning multiple schools and races and income levels.  Some classes could have separate tracks (normal and advanced, for example) split into different standardized lessons with different standardized tests.\n\nThe standardized test results will be analyzed to see which lesson(s) are the most successful.  \"Success\" of a lesson can be determined in multiple ways.  The simplest method would be the mean standardized test result.  It can also be fine-tuned to see which lesson(s) are the most successful for different categories of student, such as race, income level, learning style, etc.  Or, rather than just looking at the mean, it could try to minimize the number of students that fail. \n\nThe test results can be used to fine-tune future iterations of a lesson developed by a specific \"teaching team\".  For example, if one lesson did very well overall but had a particular weakness, like a particular question that most of the students missed, they could attempt to correct this weakness and re-enter the lesson into the never-ending competition.\n\nTeaching teams would be paid based on the standardized test results of the lesson and how much the lesson is used.  They would continue to be paid as long as the lesson survives the never-ending competition.  There would be some sort of pre-filtering by experts before showing the lesson to actual students, and \"teaching teams\" would not get paid unless the lesson passes this pre-filtering process.   Ultimately, if this becomes a national program, some of the most successful \"teaching teams\" will become millionaires. \n\nSome of the \"teaching teams\" will actually be individuals, such as hobbyists or professionals in the field of study (i.e. not necessarily teachers) that will maintain a small set of lessons.  Some of them will be small or mid-sized companies that employ full-time computer animators and human psychology experts and entertainers (comedians, journalists, famous scientists, etc.), and will work on continuously improving their active lessons, finding new lessons to work on that they consider weak and that they can defeat in competition, creating new lessons for new classes, etc.  Once a lesson passes the pre-filtering process, all competing \"teaching teams\" would be able to view that lesson, so they can try to figure out ways to defeat it.  They will be able to see the test results and feedback received by the competing \"teaching teams\" as well.\n\nThe \"teach or die\" lessons would be taught either via home schooling or in actual physical schools (public or private).  The physical schools would not employ teachers in the traditional sense for the \"teach or die\" classes (which wouldn't have to be ALL of the classes), but instead would employ (low-paid) non-skilled \"organizers\" who would make sure the kids pay attention and take attendance and stuff like that.  The school could also hire skilled tutors that would be available during a \"study hall\" period or could pay for an online tutoring service.  \n\nIf successful, the \"teach or die\" system could drastically improve the quality of education and provide equal opportunity to education, and at the same time drastically reduce the cost of education (because it doesn't involve paying \"teachers\").  This reduction of cost could be so immense (literally cut in half or more) that large supplementary projects could be implemented, such as round-the-clock free child care and recreational activities on school premises, universal free access to child psychologists, etc.\n\n Additional thoughts:\n\n* Classes could be taught to different sets of students at different times, that way there is always a fresh set of test results to use as feedback for continuously improving the lessons.  So, for example, there could be 12 sets of students each taught one month apart, thus allowing the \"teaching teams\" the remainder of the month to improve the lesson for the next set of students.  This could also allow the students to be separated by birthday, thus eliminating the unfair advantage some students receive by being older compared to the other students in their grade due to the time of year of their birthday\n\n* I think there is an unfair bias against using videos for teaching.  I think this is due to propaganda fed to us as children by teachers who were trying to get disinterested students to do their schoolwork instead of watching TV for entertainment purposes.  It is also based on cable TV historical or scientifically branded channels not really being educational, and containing cheap reality shows and conspiracy shows instead.  Also, many videos shown in school were shown only because the regular teacher was absent thus reducing the likelihood of getting in trouble for not paying attention, often didn't have relevance to the class or weight on the student's grade, and often weren't always created with the goal of being shown in a classroom, all of which reduced their effectiveness.  I think kids would quickly get used to learning effectively from videos rather than in-person teachers, and wouldn't screw around and refuse to pay attention like previous generations of students did when watching videos.\n\n* The video lessons wouldn't have to be documentary-style, rather they could be video of a teacher writing on a chalkboard.  Also, competing lessons could be of different formats, for example, a chalkboard lecture video vs. a video with animations and whiz-bang visual effects vs. an interactive web page vs. a combination of all of the above.\n\n* Some of the lessons could involve homework\n\n* Some of the standardized tests and homework could be turned in to the unskilled caretaker, who could digitize it to be graded remotely\n\n* Some classes would be less amenable to this system and may still be taught by regular teachers as decided by the school. \n\n* Some interactive learning, such as science experiments, could be done by part-time employees (similar to substitute teachers) or by employees that are full-time and normally serve as study-hall tutors\n\n* The students wouldn't be able to ask questions during the lesson.  This might superficially appear to be a large downside in the \"teach or die\" methodology, but if you think about the nature of a student asking a question in a class, it can either signify a) that particular student didn't understand, but most or all of the other students did, in which case you are wasting the other students time (to some degree, since they may gain some value from repetition, although that same repetition could be built into the lesson); or b) most or all of the students didn't understand, because maybe the teacher made a mistake or went too fast or something, which can be gradually eliminated in the iterative improvements of the \"teach or die\" methodology.\n\n* Maybe the students could (in real-time) submit questions electronically to be used by the \"teaching teams\" to improve the lectures.  And the tutors could provide feedback to the \"teaching teams\" as well. ",

            "selftext": "I'm not really good with 3D modeling software, and I've recently been trying to find some way to make my own D&D miniatures for Tabletop Simulator. While searching, I stumbled upon Fuse CC. It sort of worked... but left a lot to be desired -- for somebody like me who can't make their own models, I found that the hairstyle/clothing/etc. choices were very limited, and posing the character was a whole 'nother beast (importing into Blender and doing a bunch of things that I didn't really understand). So that leads me to this idea for a 3D character creator.\n\n* The main thing should be that it's highly moddable. The base program would only come with a few default options for meshes, leaving the rest to community creators. Because of this, the program should either be open-sourced OR available for a reasonable price (maybe on Steam with workshop support?)\n* To expand on the moddability thing, people should be able to make base meshes for creatures that aren't necessarily human that can be edited, too. Do you want a dog character? Sure, it may not be included with the base game, but I'm sure somebody would make a mod for it.\n* Parts of the models should be easily edited. Have you ever played with The Sims 4's character creation? It's really simple and quite easy to get things looking the way you want. A system sort of like this would be mandatory to keep things simple.\n* Posing models shouldn't be overly complicated. Maybe even include a user-made pose library and allow people to share theirs with other people?\n* Models should be easy to export for various programs. Have options to choose whether or not the textures are all in one image file or if they're separated by different parts. Heck, you could even include an option to include no textures for people who want to 3D print their creations.\n* Depending on the development team's opinion, they could include a clause in the Terms of Service indicating that any models generated cannot be used for commercial use, unless they're fine with that sort of thing.\n\nI'm not sure how feasible this would be to make, but honestly, I think it would be really cool to see how something like this pans out.",

            "selftext": "By \"dynamic scene\" I mean a scene with a lot of stuff moving around.\n\nWatch the first 20 seconds of [this clip from Scream (1996)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWxSBbBX4fs) (Warning: may be upsetting/NSFW, as it contains violence/swearing)\n\nYou can see a lot of jaggies/aliasing on the girl's sweater which really take you out of the scene. This got me wondering:\n\n**Would it be possible to use the principle of interlacing- taking the information in two adjacent frames to try to increase refresh rate- and apply it instead with the goal of improving picture quality by allowing for more anti-aliasing, as noise could be a less significant issue?**\n\nThis is hard to explain, but I will try.\n\nLet's take 2 adjacent frames from the first 20 seconds. Let's say we want to apply anti-aliasing on frame 1. Whether anti-aliasing an image or an individual frame of a videogame, all anti-aliasing is speculative, because the next picture, or frame, isn\u2019t known.\n\nIn a video clip, however, the program \u201cknows\u201d the next frame (Frame 2) as well as the frame it wants to apply anti-aliasing to (Frame 1). I will call this \u201ccorrective anti-aliasing\u201d for lack of a better term. So it seems that a program should be able to:\n\n1: Apply anti-aliasing to frame 1\n\n2: Interlace between frame 1 and frame 2\n\n3: Compare anti-aliased frame 1 to frame 2 and the frame produced by interlacing with the goal of detecting noise generated in the anti-aliasing process\n\n4: remove detected noise from anti-aliased frame 1\n\nIt seems like it would be possible to repeat this process several times, allowing you to in effect remaster a movie without needing to go back to the original film.\n\nWhat are the drawbacks to this method? I\u2019m guessing someone has tried to do this already and it failed due to cost/not providing significant improvements enough to warrant the effort/being too computationally expensive",

There would be a \"god-like\" character, telling you where to go and what to do, and you have to follow out those orders.\n\nI just thought this would be a really cool idea, and wanted some opinions. Let me know what you guys think.\n\nBTW, feel free to steal this idea if you happen to work in a game development studio, because i have no idea how to make video games.\n\nEdit: if somebody does make this game, i better get a free copy!",

            "selftext": "A huge advantage of digital (e.g. PDF/ebook/kindle) books over paper books is that you can search for anything and have quick results. Indexes do the same thing but are much slower and sometimes what you're looking for has alternate names or is the second word of a the index entry which ends up somewhere else in the index than you'd expect. e.g. the entry for Rheumatic Arthritis says \"see Arthritis.\" \n\nWhat I do to solve this problem is to search the PDF on the computer and go to the page I want on the physical book. Searching huge PDF files (1000+ page textbooks) is slow even for fast computers. It' impossible to do with the phone/tablet, something a dedicated app or website could solve. If I'm using this trick heavily, I separate the index (+/- table of contents) from the body of the ebook/pdf file and it's done much faster (almost doable on the phone/tablet) but I often loose them after I'm done with that textbook for the foreseeable future. It's just not an elegant solution. \n\nIt'd be amazing if there was a platform that did that. Preferably it'd be free, but it could monetise by charging publishers for including their books (of course few would do that at first) or have pro features such as searching through the whole book or automatically separating the index of a ebook/pdf file you upload (not everyone has the know-how/persistence/time to do that, as simple as it may seem). Book Ads. Eventually, book sales.\n\nLet's not get into the discussion of *why not just use digital book*. There are many, many threads on /r/books on the topic.\n\nEdit: Title correction: **and** returns results",

            "selftext": "This could be a Chrome extension, or perhaps an idea to share with Facebook programmers, but here's the problem:\n\n- Many people get their news online.\n- Many people would like their news sources to be unbiased.\n- Many people don't expend the effort to research claims/facts behind articles, instead assuming credibility based on where the article came from or who shared it (I don't exclude myself from this - time is a valuable thing!).\n\nSo here's the basic premise of my idea:\n\nI'd like there to be a software add-on which allows an equal number of people from both sides of the political spectrum, completely bi-partisan, to weigh in on whether or not any given article is biased one way or the other. From there, websites can be given percentage ratings for partisan bias which will show up through the add-on whenever an article from the website is clicked.\n\nPeople would sign up for \"Bias Meter\" (or something with a much catchier name). They would tell the service what their political leaning is (liberal, conservative). Then, they click on an article. They read the article. They get a feel for whether the article is fact-based and unbiased, or whether it has language or claims leaning unnecessarily towards one political viewpoint or the other, perhaps doing some background research in the process. Then when they go to leave the page, they're asked whether they thought the article leaned: very conservative / slightly conservative / unbiased / slightly liberal / very liberal.\n\nResults would be averaged on either side of the political divide before taking all feedback into consideration. Duration of time spent on the article could be factored in. Frequency of one user giving lots of articles any given rating could be factored in. Complete outliers / protest votes could be factored out.\n\nThe result would be: anyone clicking on an article (say, on the Facebook trending feed) would have a percentage rating immediately displayed on their \"Bias-o-meter\" which would provide an indication of where articles on that site tend to lean, or if it's truly a trustworthy, non-partisan news source. They would have the feedback of people on both sides to fall back on.\n\nWhat do you think? I'd be happy to collaborate and work out some math on this, but I had the idea the other day, and since my programming skills aren't so good, I wanted to get it out there in case some capable individual wants to run with it.",

            "selftext": "So I was taking a bath and thinking about the election and I got an idea. I've always felt that the best person to be a leader is someone who doesn't want to be. They have no outside motives, no tyrannical tendencies, no major ideology, maybe even humility, or humanity even. This was a perk of the feudal system. Think Ned Stark in Game of Thrones. On the opposite side of that coin you have Joffrey someone born into power with all the wrong qualities of a leader. That's what lead us to democracy. Holding an election for someone the people deem to have the proper qualities of a leader. But the way our system works currently we are unable to elect someone who doesn't want to rule. The only people who want to rule us are people who very well may have ulterior motives. (Not just this cycle but every cycle.)\n\nSo then I thought maybe there was a way to crowdsource an entire political party on the idea that the members of the party pick a person at random they believe to have no interest in ruling the nation. Maybe a gardener or a plumber, a magician just ordinary people who have no real desire to rule the country. \n\nSo each person who joins the party pays like 100 and gives a nomination. We weed out the ones that are jokes (animals, celebrities, dead people) then we hold an open election using the funds from the nomination process. \n\nThen we take the top 5 and hold our closed primary election / fundraiser. We raise money for our (hopefully) neutral leader. \n\nThe end result should be enough money for a campaign (online at least) as well as a candidate who possesses all the qualities of a good leader. \n\nAnyway I rushed out of the bath to write this idea down in r/crazyideas but they have a ban on all political ideas and I smoke joints in the bath tub so when I came out the smoke detector started going off. So that made me think of a Light Bulb and I think that maybe this is a good idea. \n\nI'm open to criticisms, comments, and following other bonus political party ideas. \n\nWe have an open election to program the personality of an AI that we have run in the election.\n\nWe elect more (better) celebrities.\n\nAnimals? \n",

            "selftext": "Those that control the means of production, controls the money. Those that controls the money, controls the people. So in order for people to be free, people would have to have control of the means of production. Ask yourself, right now, who controls the means of production? I know I don't control the means of production. I know the people I work with don't control the means of production. My friends and families don't and I'm pretty sure my neighbors don't control the means of production. Currently, the banks and corporations controls the means of production. Our laws and policies have been written by the elites in groups like the CFR (Council of Foreign Relations), an organization comprised of politicians, corporate leaders, and bankers, and ALEC (American Legislative Exchange Council), an organization of lawyers that write the laws from plans developed by CFR and then passed to congress to get approved. The banks control the money. They print paper dollar notes that are backed by nothing. Paper money is usually backed by something that holds value like metals, gold and silver. The dollars the elites give us have no real value and they haven't had value since 1971 when Nixon took America off the gold standard to fund the Vietnam War. So, now we have a class of people that has control of the means of production and the money, which therefore means they have control over the people. They can now charge people with crimes and detain people indefinitely or until the War on Terrorism ends. They now have legal power to silence any dissenters. They literally have full control of our lives right now. They tell us we have to go to school and learn material they want us to learn. They make us work 40 hours a week while trying to support families on such low wages while trying to pay off debt that is necessary for a good quality of life. We are forced into slavery! Now that we established that the people no longer have control of America, we have to ask ourselves, what can we do about it? Well, the first step is to educate the people of the problem. All our lives, we are told that the world we live in today, is the only way of life. So it's understandable that so many people don't see a problem with the current system we live in. The elites have been using propaganda to sway the minds of the American people for a very long time. They've perfected the art and have written books on the subject that anyone can read. Seriously, look up Edward Bernays's book,\"Propaganda\". Edward Bernays coined the term 'Public Relations' in the 1920's to mask its intentions, which was to distribute propaganda to regular American people. Once a good majority of people is educated of the crimes the elites have committed, the people can stand together to take down the current system and destroy the status quo they tell us we have to follow. We can Revolutionize. I know what you're thinking. Revolution is such a powerful word. It means overthrowing your government that has had control of you all your life. What do we do after we take down the government? Who's going to lead the people? What will we use as money? How do we ensure that any new monetary system we create, can keep the means of production in the hands of the people? Well, the answer is pretty simple really. I've put together a new economic strategy and monetary reform plan that could, quite literally, end all inequality due to wealth distribution. Most people think that we should just go back to the gold standard and all our problems will resolve themselves out. Well, that solves the fake money issue, but that doesn't solve the problem of who controls the means of production because right now all the major corporations control the means of production. So, to ensure the people own the means of production, I want to institute an Economy that uses two forms of money. The first form of money will be the dollar, backed by gold, printed and regulated by the U.S. treasury and not by the Federal Reserve, a private bank institution owned by all the big banks. Now bear with me and keep an open mind, the second form of money will be what I like to call a grow note, backed by marijuana and hemp, printed and regulated by community grow exchanges. If marijuana and hemp was completely legal and anyone could grow it, with no regulations at all, people could grow there own money! Individuals can harvest their plants and exchange them to grow exchanges for grow notes. Grow exchanges can then store, produce products, and exchange raw material to buyers for dollars. The grow note can have its own market index putting value to the notes. Products and services can be priced in dollars and grow notes at their own rates. This would free anyone to do what they really want to do in life. Instead of working half your life away working a job that you don't care about, for wages that barely keep food on the table for you and your family, you can just grow some plants and work on things that make you happy. Currently, I have most of the big picture stuff worked out, but I could use some help working out the fine details of such a plan. If anyone thinks this idea is a viable plan and can help in any way to make it happen, feel free to message me. If you don't have any idea how we could implement such an idea, but you like what it can do for people, feel free to spread the idea around and maybe capable people will pick up on it.

How funny would it be to put 30 fake marijuana plants out behind your house, have the cops go full-on raid, only to find out they were silk the whole time? #wastetheirtime2016!\n\nAnd then I thought - what if every person who wanted legalization in a major prohibition state (like Kansas) was putting one in their window? A few in their garden? A hundred in a hidden spot that could only be seen by plane?  Imagine how law enforcement would have to change their approach to handling marijuana - They would be forced to prioritize major illegal grows instead of ANYONE with a pot plant.\n\nI am thinking about starting a fundraiser specifically to get these faux plants manufactured. Turns out, fake marijuana plants aren't easy to come by - because nobody is making them! There is ONE realistic plant for sale that I could find, but it sells for over $100. My goal is to buy in bulk so that the plants can be affordable for those who want to protest prohibition WITHOUT risking a criminal charge or breaking the bank.\n\nWhy fake plants? They take no time, resources, or maintenance, and there is no law that says you can't own a fake plant! I want to make this a low cost method of protest, and easily available to all. \n\nRight now I'm just trying to figure out how to even get custom silk plants made - \n\nSo what do you guys think? Please help talk myself out of pursuing this. \n\n\nEdit: I started an indiegogo. Until I can get more information, this is all I can do for now. https://igg.me/at/382BsgiDFCA",

It seems antiquated that we should have to ask employees where things are instead of looking it up on a phone. Major supermarkets already have a functional digital infrastructure for inventory. They should make an app that includes a full searchable list of inventory and the exact in-store location of each item so people know just where to find things. \nI know part of the business model of large stores is to purposefully make people browse the shelves to find what they're looking for and this system would affect that, but I think the downsides would be offset by the benefits of a more positive shopping experience and the ability of supermarkets to track purchases and make recommendations similar to Amazon's system.",

Would have to work through insurance/privacy issues on this.\n- Support Group App --> Connect with others dealing with similar issues to talk through problems. I know plenty of sites like Reddit may have this but this app/website would be dedicated to this mission.\n- Discovery --> Helps you find books, music, movies, games, etc. through recommendations from friends. I am always hearing people say \"Have you seen \"______\" or read \"______\". It would be cool to have an app where people could give entertainment recommendations.\n- Pantry/Fridge Inventory --> Take a pic of your grocery shopping receipt and the app stores this information and can create meals based on what you have. Could also help you track when you run out of milk and expiration dates.\n- Clickbait Killer --> Possible Chrome Extension that reveals the main idea of an article with a clickbait headline so you don't have to read the whole thing.\n\nWhat other problems exist that could be solved or made better with digital technology?",

            "selftext": "De GU10 fitting werd oorspronkelijk ontwikkeld voor halogeenspots. Maar nu LED spots veelal de boventoon voeren, zijn er tegenwoordig ook talloze GU10 LED spots op de markt. \n\nDe GU10 fitting is, samen met de E14 en E27 fitting, een van de meest voorkomende fittingen binnenshuis. Ze zijn te herkennen aan een zogenaamde bajonetsluiting met twee kleine pinnetjes met een ruimte ertussen van 10 millimeter. Een GU10 fitting moet u een kwartslag draaien als deze in de lamphouder is geplaatst. \n\nOver de GU10 LED spot\nGU10 LED spots werken direct op het 230V netwerk. De levensduur ligt tussen de 20.000 en 50.000 uur en er is geen externe trafo nodig bij een GU10 LED spot. Wat natuurlijk een groot voordeel is. \n\nEr zijn diverse lichtkleuren beschikbaar als u kiest voor een GU10 LED spot, namelijk: neutraal wit, daglicht wit, warm wit en extra warm wit. Ook de kleur en de buitenkant van het materiaal kan verschillen: er zijn zwarte, witten en zilvergrijze GU10 LED spotjes. \n\nWattages en Lumen van GU10 LED spots\nEr zijn verschillende wattages in GU10 LED spots. Zo zijn er spotjes van 5W, 10W maar ook van 15W. De meeste GU10 LED spotjes gaan tot een wattage van 35W. Ook niet geheel onbelangrijk is het aantal Lumen. Met Lumen wordt de lichtsterkte per Watt uitgedrukt. Hoe meer Lumen, hoe hoger het wattage en omgekeerd. LED lampen hebben ongeveer 80 Lumen per Watt. \n\nHet dimmen van een GU10 LED spot\nZoals gezegd is er bij een GU10 LED spot geen dimmer nodig. Nog zo\u2019n leuk voordeel is dat een GU10 LED spot de mogelijkheid \u2018Dimtone\u2019 heeft. Dit betekent dat de kleur van het licht warmer wordt op het moment dat u de lamp dimt. De kleurtemperatuur verschuift bij het dimmen van 2700K naar 2200K.\n\nWil je nog meer interessante weetjes over GU10 LED spots?

            "selftext": "Start with Major franchises (Pitfall, Super Mario, Sonic, Zelda etc) Then on to more of the obscure games or games without a \"franchise\" (River Raid, Act Raiser, Hero).\n\nI'll use Pitfall as an example:  These games are sold on current generation systems.  They start with the original graphics and gameplay, so Pitfall is the classic Atari 2600 side-scrolling adventure.  Gameplay is the same as the originals with one exception, there are all kinds of trophies/achievements and a certain goal(s), that, when reached unlocks a new improved version. For Pitfall it might be the Super NES version.  Again, same deal the whole game is present with achievements and when a certain goal(s) is/are met, it unlocks a more current generation version. This continues on up till we are playing a version of pitfall on a current generation system - maybe it looks a little like a tomb raider game - but fully 3D - maybe even with VR.  \n\n*  Current generation systems have the power to run these games and the \"current version\" doesn't have to be super in depth. We don't need fancy cut scenes or dialog (unless it's part of the franchise). A fully rendered 3D sand-box type jungle to run around in and find random gold bars while swinging on ropes and avoiding scorpions - would be pretty entertaining on it's own.\n\n*  After levels are unlocked you can go back and replay them. You can also unlock cheats and tricks to make the originals more fun, easier, or harder to your tastes. You can combine these cheats/tweaks to you're liking and then share the combinations with friends and compete\n\n*  Franchises are already established - so less marketing is needed.  Older players with disposable income will buy these games and younger players will want to match skills/show off.\n\n\nPossibilities include playing an Atari/Intellivision/Coleco game to unlock the Arcade version of the same game.  (Tron's Deadly Disc's (Intellivision), leads to the Tron Arcade which leads to a new Tron side scroller equivalent to 16 bit technology,  which leads to a current generation Tron game that uses VR.  Seriously - disc wars in VR??  Disney is good at monetizing - this game could be several - one for each variety of Tron games found in the arcade for example)   \n\nAfter the bigger franchises are out and the trend catches on there are LOADS of games to work with, many under-appreciated.  In this time of reboots and nostalgia why not leverage the positive emotions associated with older games - and bring them to the current generation?\n\n\nPlease Take My Money",

            "selftext": "I just copy pasted this post from r/anime, and I'm probably the billionth guy to come in here with a \"totally rad and original animu idea\", but I'd appreciate it if someone saw this:\n\nIf you could all just bear with my dumb-American-ass for a moment please, I've recently been on what I call a \"patriotism binge\", where I read and watch a lot of stuff that provides an external view on my country (I also try to watch as listen to as much negative commentary as I do positive). I like to see how the world views my country, and maybe learn a thing or two about other cultures that can help me be a better person in general.\n\nI recently thought up a world that I feel can serve to show off the best qualities from the \"big\" modern countries, at least as I see it. This alternate future would be post-scarcity after a global EMP wiped out all electronics. In fact it was so massive that residual waves still wash over everything on a consistent basis, so faraday cages don't even help because you can't take anything out of them (please correct me if I'm wrong about this, it just needs all electronics gone).\n\nNaturally, for the first world countries everything went to shit really fast. Typical civil conflict and people dying due to a lack of advanced medical equipment. Literally everything just stops.\n\nThe Anime, however, takes place not during or even near the end of all this but actually around a decade or so after. New countries have sprouted up everywhere, and global communication is being reestablished slowly but surely. Except now everything is basically industrial age tech.\n\nNow, the countries that appear are basically the same (Japan is still Japan, Britain is still Britain, and so on), but obviously borders and governments have seen massive overhauls. This is where things start to take a more optimistic tone.\n\nThe new version of each country represents that country's best aspects, while the flaws of each one still remain but to a much lesser extent. I don't know how this would look for other countries, probably a new more democratic Shoganistic state for Japan, benevolent monarchies in Europe, more peaceful tribes in Africa, etc. In America I'd like to think it's the return of post-revolution culture and society, but with less racism and sexism and just in general a more modern understanding of the world. Basically the most idealistic looks on each nation, modern values mixed with old and characteristic stuff/tech.\n\nThen obviously it would take place in Japan. Probably following some kid as some kind of Samurai apprentice, who is guarding the Japanese ambassador. That way he gets to see the world and how it has changed.\n\nShitty, meh, or probable?\n\nThanks for reading.",

Depending on the amount of accounts, this can be pretty time-consuming, especially when there are a lot of people that you want to keep up with! \n\nInstead, it would be really neat if an app existed with one username.

Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Reddit, Vine (*rip*), Email, #, etc.\n\n(I go up to someone, say \"hey, pull up \"PixelyPirate\" on *insert app name here.*\" I set my Facebook and Twitter to pull up, and they can add me whenever they so please.)\n\nEDIT: \nI guess I didn't explain it well enough? You aren't logging in, you simply download the app, insert your social media names in the fields you want; (Say I want to add my twitter account, and my phone number.) You say to another person, \"I'd love to talk to you in the future!, I'm PixelyPirate on *insert the app name here.* They pull that up, and your twitter and phone number are there where you can easily follow/save their contact info.\n\n",

This would mean I owe them 'x' -- If someone owes me 'x' for something else, essentially I don't owe anything. The person from whom I've borrowed it from can redeem what they are owed from other sources similarly.\n\nThis form of trading 'owes' is very useful and can prevent bad debt from flooding the market. It also reduces your dependency on cash itself.\n\nObviously, there is a lot of discussions that need to happen before this idea can be completely validated.\n\nWould like Reddit to help me out :)\n\nLooking forward!",

            "selftext": "Imagine with your bank you could have many sub-categories in your bank account all for different purposes. A \"gift\" account where you transfer an amount for gifts, a \"utilities\" account for your gas/water/electricity bills etc, a \"rent\" account, \"groceries\", \"pets\", \"xmas\", \"insurance\", \"clothing\" etc...\n\nYour salary would still go into a general main account, and then you set up automatic transfers from that account into all your other accounts.\n\nWhen the time comes to pay your gas bill for example, you already have the money there ready to go.\n\nA lot of companies offer a 'direct debit' type arrangement where they would take the money out of your account, but that's only useful if you have the money there for them to take. When all funds are coming out of the main account without your control, it gets very overwhelming.\n\nIt can be very difficult to ensure that money is away and not spent prior to that expense coming up.\n\nSome would argue that you just need to be more disciplined with your money, and that's fine for some personality types, but a lot of people need that extra help when it comes to finances. It's one thing to prepare a budget, but another to stick to it. \n\nWhen you prepare a budget you're designating funds to each of the categories anyway so why not have a micro account for each of those categories?\n\nThoughts?\n\nAs a side note - I live in Australia so my country's banks and economy might work differently to yours.",

            "selftext": "After regretfully trying to follow this years election I got an idea. With the trend in declining cable subscriptions there are still some gaps in online media that aren't fully dominated by mainstream media. Outlets like YouTube, Twitch TV, Facebook and smaller online communities like Imgur. I don't know about bigger media platforms such as Netflix or Hulu but those would be ideal.\n\nFor the format of the network it would be very similar to Imgur or Reddit with up votes serving as an active polling of candidates. During the primaries it would be similar to your local public access channel, anyone and your mother can upload their platform. When the general election starts we take the top 10 polling candidates and air the debates on all the media outlets we can get our hands on during mainstream media debates. \n\nI know I am just dreaming in hypotheticals and if such a network were to rise it would be a few election cycles before it would effectively work if it gains traction. Even with senate and house elections it could net results in bringing about an end to a two party system. As our children and their children grow up are they going to face the same broken system or is there still some hope to bring about a unbiased platform. In twenty years Fox,CNN,MNSBC and all the other clowns will still be around but with the way people consume media evolving it would be nice to see there ratings at an all time low.",

            "selftext": "Dear Reader,\nNamaste!\n\nA friend and I just had a conversation that I want to share with you.\nThe value of our current money is based on nothing and it oly works because we believe in it.- Because it is based on nothing we cannot control it and a lot of problems seem to result from that. What if a nation, or ideally the whole world, would issue money to peopleand base its value on the working power of the people who receive that money? The value would be based on goods, production, scientific ideas, art, everything that people do. Everyone would get their money directly from the state, so the system would not function for profit anymore but for improvement of the state which should ultimately be the well being of its citizens. We could make sure that teachers, construction site workers, farmers, scientists and artists earn enough, because the contribution that the people make for society determines the worth of the money. The way we see it, the power would shift back from money to the people. Governments as job creators could give out money for all kinds of beneficial acts, be it sweeping the streets, or performing an operation as a doctor. We could find a job for everyone, our schools would not have to prepare the children for a life that revolves around money, but support each talent equally, because everything they love and that is useful to people can earn them their living. We could fund every project to make our lives more sustainable or to raise awareness for our rights, which is nothing else than acknowledging the power that we have in each other and seeing it rootet in the incredible gift that is the soul.\nThe power lies with the people. If the people see that, why would they give their power over to a system where it ends up with the money?\nBesides who are the ones profiting from our current system? I can't make out anyone. The rich people I know are confused, unhappy, overworked, lonely. They think they have power, but they only have money. The real one having power is still money itself. EVERYONE could capitalize on the new system\n\nBeloved reader, I will close similar to the way I started, with wisdom from which everything else comes naturally and easily.\n\nI honor the place in you where Spirit lives\nI honor the place in you which is\nof Love, of Truth, of Light, of Peace,\nwhen you are in that place in you,\nand I am in that place in me,\nthen we are One.",

(Basically catacombs under my school) While I was back there, I entered into a dark abandoned exercise room and off to the side of that there is this huge abandoned shower room (kind of looks like a gas chamber) with very bright lights and a bunch of leaky shower heads with rust all over the wall that makes them look like they haven't been in use for decades. I have a free period during the day, and during this period, I file into the locker room amidst the students who are actually in gym wait until the teacher walks towards the back of the locker room telling everyone to leave, run to the side door of the locker room (everyone else exits through the front door, exit the door, stick my glove the door so it doesn't lock, wait for the teacher to go out the other door, go back in to the locker room and navigate to the shower room aforementioned. I did some tests to see if anyone ever goes in there by littering paper all over the floor, and low and behold, it was still there two weeks later. I then realized that I basically had this room all to my self, so I was thinking about what I could do with a room with a constant supply of water and bright light. Then it hit me: an underground secret garden in my own school! I did some calculations and found out that if I bring a sac of soil everyday to school in my backpack, it would take 4 months to cover the back left quarter of the room with soil. Then I can purchase seeds and plant them and see if they grow. I'm currently doing research into which plants will grow best in the conditions of that room, but I've mapped out the general design of the garden. (A radial pattern of flowers and small bushes). When it has grown into a garden, I will leave a suicide note, and music to alert people to come back there. Then they will discover that I unfortunately died, but I created life before my demise, so the cycle continues. (How poetic!) Why am I willing to do something this dumb, well, cuz I'm gonna die soon anyway. If I miraculously manage to heal before I kill myself, well, then someone's gonna go back there years in the future and find a legit garden growing! Thanks for reading!",

            "selftext": "This is a potentially super profitable business model although it might sound absurd. \n\nIf you have never heard of Schroedinger\u2019s cat and its Copenhagen/many worlds interpretations, take a few minutes to read about the thought experiment below.  \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_suicide_and_immortality\n\nAlthough the many-worlds interpretation cannot be proven true, nor is it refutable, individuals may be able to experience immortality if the many-worlds interpretation is correct. The theory says that if you are subject to a conditional suicide that is triggered by a quantum device, with 50% chance killing you. This process will repeat every 10 seconds. Within a minute, 6 rounds of conditional suicide would lower the survival rate to 1.56%, and in 5 minutes the probability of survival is virtually zero. However, if the many-worlds interpretation is correct, there will be a universe where the individual survives no matter how many rounds of quantum suicide he has committed. In such universe after the experimenter has survived 5 minutes (30 rounds) it is quite convincing to everyone that many-worlds interpretation is correct. And in that particular universe this theory will have been proven true, while billions of copies of the experimenter died in other universes, in which his consciousness no longer exists, therefore the only experience he will have is with the universe in which he survived. \n\nSo here is the business model. Since in our universe, the experimenter is certainly going to die, while the individual will survive in one of the infinite universes and his consciousness will continue if MWI is true. For all the MWI believers who are not satisfied with their current lives, we could charge them $50,000 to be the experimenter. We will be paying the experimenter $1 billion only if he survives. Although the business should be backed by a VC fund or a bunch of investors in case such impossible event does occur, the risk is virtually zero. As for the experimenter, if the MWI is true, his consciousness will continue in the universe where he survives and becomes a self-made billionaire, and in that universe MWI and quantum immortality will be proven true.  \n\nAssuming the cost of conducting such quantum suicide is $1,000 for each experimenter, annual profit of the business will be (50,000 \u2013 1,000) x number of experimenters every year. Say 1,000 people are willing to do this every year, annual profit would be around $49,000,000, with minimal investment (just need to build the quantum suicide machine) and no risks.     \n\nSome additional thoughts:\nSounds too good to be true right? It\u2019s a win-win game to everyone, both the business owner and the experimenter. Even if there\u2019s 50% chance that MWI is true, the expected return of the experimenter is still 50% x (1b \u2013 50,000) = $499,975,000.  If the MWI theory has 1% chance being true, the expected return is still an astonishing $9,950,000. Although Copenhagen interpretation could be a more popular choice than MWI among the scientists, it\u2019s still safe to say that many people including some physicists believe in MWI and there\u2019s at least 1% (based on people\u2019s judgement) chance it is true. \n\nSo where does the value come from since everyone\u2019s expected return is surprisingly high and all we do is letting someone commit suicide. It has something to do with the experimenter\u2019s assessment of the probability of MWI being true. If Copenhagen interpretation is correct, then there\u2019s 0 chance the experimenter will survive and receive the 1 billion payout. Hence his actual expected return is -$50,000, not to mention losing his life. However, even though the Copenhagen interpretation is more mainstream, MWI is still somewhat promising and irrefutable. If this interpretation is true, the value is created in a similar way that insurance industry creates value. In this case, however, it\u2019s us (doing the same business) in other trillions of universes similar to ours that bear the risks with us, with each of them having virtually zero risk of going bankrupt (paying 1 billion). In that particular universe where the experimenter survives, the copies of us will, unfortunately, have to pay out that 1 billion. But I\u2019m sure even in that universe we will find a way to monetize our revolutionary discovery and fame thanks to proving MWI. \n\nNick W.\n",

            "selftext": "It's common belief that we store more memories than we think, we just can't access them all.  Have you ever not remembered something and then someone gave you a little bit of information about it and you said, \"Oh yeah, I remember that!\"  So what if we all kept a log on a computer of memories, and made the memories indexed. You write down a short excerpt of what happened and you can later go back and search through the memories using an ANN. The ANN would let the computer interpret what you probably mean and search the database for you. Would this be a good idea? Every day when you get home you write what happened with lots of keywords. The artificial neural network would add tags based on fuzzy logic.  There is a large potential of things that could be done with it.  If any of you have seen google photos, it can recognize what is in a picture and give it tags.  If you wore a gopro on your head all day long you could have the computer guess what happened and add tags and use geolocation and facial recognition to have a lot of data.\nThoughts?",

            "selftext": "I understand that there are countless organisations around the world working towards this aim. But, as a global push (the first time in history) could people not take this upon themselves to solve a global crisis? It is beyond belief that people still don\u2019t have access to clean water. Just think about it. In 2010 when the UN released the estimate above to $10 billion dollars, the population of the US were spending $20 billion dollars a year on PET FOOD! \n\nThe population of the world is 6 billion people. 60% of the world\u2019s population live on over $2.50 a day (the poverty line is set at $1.90 a day). So theoretically that leaves 60% of 6 billion, 3600000000 people, who would be able to contribute $1 a year towards a yearly global fund to tackle the crisis. Even taking into account the fact that, obviously, not every one of the 3600000000-people able to would actually contribute; but in the same respect it\u2019s also likely people (celebrities, companies etc) who are able to would and could contribute more. \n\nI think a lot of people don\u2019t like contributing funds for charities addressing this as they don\u2019t know where it goes or how it is used.  On top of this, a lot of NGOs ask for a higher contribution than $1, for example UNICEF the lowest single contribution you can make (in the UK) is \u00a330. I think this puts A LOT of people off. \n\nWhat if one person were to set up a global donation page with a year\u2019s timeframe with the sole goal of $10 billion? I completely understand this is a shit ton of money. But in a year, globally, is it really not obtainable? Hell, the cost for the UK to replace Trident (a nuclear sub) is approx. \u00a3250 billion; my point being that millions of people throughout the world have no control on how their taxes are used, and their taxes are a hell of a lot higher than I\u2019m asking for. \n\nWith the power of social media across the globe, where a boy pointing at a pair of shoes saying \u201cWhat are those!\u201d can get global recognition, would it not be negligent not to try to set up a global donation page to tackle this head on? In the same light, this fund would not be used for any wages, no hidden agenda, complete transparency. Hell, put it in my name and I would open up my finances for all the world to see.\n\nThe obvious question is: How dumb am I to think I know how to spend $10 billion and resolve the worlds water crisis? Well, I have no idea how to do that. Not the foggiest. BUT people do. There are people that have spent their lives on this issue. If you turned around to the GENUINE EXPERTS and said: \u201cI have $10 Billion, now can we ALL put our heads together to use this and find a solution.\u201d I mean the UN estimate of $10 billion wasn\u2019t just plucked out of the air, presumably the UN came to that figure after consulting experts from around the world. Again, with the issue of transparency, the money for the fund would not be used for ANYTHING other than providing clean water. I\u2019m sure there are genuine experts around the globe who would chomp at the bit to help pro bono if the end result was actually attainable/in sight, if not then it would just take one company (such as google) to sponsor them.\n\nIf you don\u2019t think that this issue would garner any social media response, well you simply don\u2019t know that. If ANYTHING above seems to make the slightest bit of sense, would it not be worth a very small risk to try? Babies, mothers, fathers, sons, brothers, sisters, daughters, people across the world die because of: Water. If there\u2019s even the slightest possibility that a YEARLY target of $10 GLOBALLY even could make the situation better, shouldn\u2019t we try? It would be the first time in the history of time that the world\u2019s population could realistically work together, from the bottom up, to address a global crisis? \n\nI know it look like I\u2019m over simplifying a very complex issue, that\u2019s not my intention. But I don\u2019t see why it would work or at least why no one has tried? \n",

Even less people know their history, bio, temperament, traits, attributes etc. It would be cool to have an app that you could take a picture of the dog with your phone, and the app will using AI, facial recognition, body mass, color of coat, weight, etc be able to tell you what breed the dog is. Then it could tell you a little history about the breed, it's origins, it's man man purpose, it's common behaviors etc.\nIt would also be cool to have the app create a pet profile for the dog. So that you can keep pictures of it growing up, it's health records, it's immunizations, and also be able to pass on or share the profile with the next owner, the shelter, or the vet. It could also store funny moments, snippets and videos of when he ran into the lake, ran away from a small frog etc. It can also be an app that has notes to let future owners know their story. For example, Rocky was almost killed by a skateboard when he was young. He's now scared of anything with wheels and will freak out. Dogs don't need social media accounts but they should be able to enjoy the benefits of technology, and a better informed owner. Just idea. But I love my dog Rocky. He's pretty cool.\n\nCredit to runway16.us\n\nhttp://runway16.us/idea/woofi-tells-you-what-breed-your-dog-is/",

You're trying to escape a science lab run by an insane robot who cares about nothing but testing your abilities to think with quantum portals and extra dimensions. What's important here is that you've got a 3D game with a level editor, puzzle elements, traps, and awesome. \n\nKing of thieves is kinda interesting. You're both player and level designer. Players see a one button platformer where your ninja burglar wants the gold. Designers defend the treasure they steal by placing the jewels behind traps, so long as they're capable of accessing the loot themselves. \n\nMy idea: Combine the two. Steal treasure, but defend your loot with puzzle elements *and* platforming skills *and* a 3D world. As long as nobody adds in logic devices so you can't make a password lock, this game will be awesome. Perhaps to facilitate this no-passwords rule we could implement a peer-review system where a randomly selected friend must solve it without communication before you're allowed to save the level.",

But in the last year I found myself subscribing to some newsletters, Medium people or even Facebook pages (mostly the companies I would like to keep an eye on). Now the information from these sources is all over the place, and it is annoying me.\n\nSo I thought it might be useful to have a single tool for all information feeds, not only RSS. I even started working on it: [konsona.com](http://konsona.com). But I am not sure: do others really need it? Please tell your opinion in the comments \u2014 would you use such a tool? Why yes? Why not? Or maybe you are already using something similar?",

            "selftext": "Hello fellow redditors!\n\nI'm a tech student from Europe and I think I get quite often good development ideas in my head, mostly about technology. The most usual time to get these ideas is exam week, since then I should be studying and brain wants to do anything else. The problem with my ideas is of course bad performance in tests, since my brain can't study enough, but also that once the exam week is over all my ideas are gone aswell. So I was thinking about sharing some of my ideas here to get feedback or some brainstorming about it. Here we go...\n\nDuring studying I ended up seeing [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UphQr5DjviQ) video from Youtube (and yes it was related to my current studies, not a funny cat video). There is a robot voice talking as if it is reading some article and there is relevant picture about the actual subject.\nWhat if there was a tool or automatic service which would make video out of some subject you want to know more about and it could do it fully programmatically? It would be cool if it filled the video with some visual content and read the text with some robot text reader ( I believe they can be quite effective atleast in english nowadays). I think wikipedia would be quite good service to try that kind of thing out since you can easily get visual content and text content regarding one article from their API (or so I think after fast googling). It could also be used with plain text and it could try to get some visual footage from some other source (google pictures). It would also be cool if it could mix some video also if available.\n\nI feel like my reading ability has decreased a lot lately and audiovisual content seems alot more easy to process and memorize. This kind of tool would also help visually impaired people. I tried to google this kind of tool, I found something remotely like it but not IT. Sorry for textvomit, english is not my native language.\n\nTL;DR\nTool to make audiovisual content easily from written documents (with pictures)",

            "selftext": "It's a simple idea but let me explain the foundation here.\n\n* Anyone who smokes cigarettes who has tried an E-Cigs can tell you that they ...sorta work. Like smoke enough and it helps but it doesn't seem to completely satisfy the normal \"fix\" one gets from a burning cigarette\n* Nicotine by itself is only mildly addictive. It's only in combination with the MAOIs (e.g., Harmane) in cigarette smoke that it seems to really create a \"hit\"\n\nSo I am forced to draw one conclusion, that to actually get cigarette smokers such as myself away from the harmful byproducts of cigarettes consumption, we need to create an E-Cig that accurately involves ALL aspects of the experience of smoking, to produce a near-identical hit. Nicotine alone does not appear to be the solution.\n\nIANAS. I know there would be some very difficult hurtles legally in doing this, but would love to hear where this falls apart medically.

            "selftext": "Feedback would be greatly appreciated It's long so thanks for reading.\n\nSo everything starts off with the end credits for spiderman homecoming. You see a crowd cheering and screaming with someone speaking. The speaker says things like Today dawns a new beginning. We shall lead the world in our conquest...stuff like that. Eventually the dude ends saying \"All shall feel the might that is Doom\", and cuts to showing Doom putting 1 fist to the air while everyone cheers....\n\nMovie starts here It maybe called Fantastic Four, but they should push for Dr. Doom to be the main focal point of the movie. simple plot points starts off with flashback of Doom's childhood of him holding valeria's hands at his mother's funeral. Borris rides on horseback coming and telling Doom and his father the King's men are coming. Doom and his father begin fleeing from Latverian army. His Father gives him a green blanket, and he flees while his dad runs back to fight of the guards\n\nflash forward to the future (around the beginning of Iron Man 1). This is shown on a television stating Tony Stark had been kidnapped. Reed says if only Stark would use his genius to progress science rather than create war weapons, which leads to a debate between Doom and Reed. Doom and Reed work for Franklin Storm on a secret mission to study cosmic rays that appear near earth. Franklin Storm knows something is not right with shield and is able to keep the secret mission from shield.\nDoom is fascinated by magic and attempts to recreate the Tesseract he has read about in mythological stories. He creates something like it, but Reed tells him his equations are off. Doom doesn't take Reed serious. He turns on his device, and a portal opens showing Asgard. Doom attempts to walk through it but his device explodes causing him to be flung towards the wall. He runs out in shame.\n\nOn his way home Reed is stopped by 4 guys telling him give them his wallet. Reed tries to run, but they tackle him down and beat him up. Ben Grim Yells for them to stop. They tell Ben Grim they aren't on Yancy Street, and for the old man to get lost. Ben takes them all out. Ben helps up Reed and tells him he was never much of a fighter. Ben has been there protecting Reed from the tough streets they grew up in since they were children.\n\nReed lives with Ben Grimm. Ben is depressed as his life is going no where. Reed asks Ben if he would like to go to space. Ben doesn't think Franklin Storm will let Ben go along, but Reed says he will tell Franklin Storm that Ben is a pilot. Ben says that wont work because ben is a forklift driver. Reed feels he owes Ben big time for being there for him since they were kids, and Reed tells Ben to just play along. Reed talks to Franklin Storm but he says no. Doom backs Reed and pushes for Storm to allow Ben to go with them. Franklin finally caves in and lets Ben go. Doom tells Reed, Reed owes him a favor.\n\nThey are introduced to Johnny and Sue storm, and Sue is excited to meet Doom, as she has read his work on wormholes. Reed introduces himself to Sue and tells her about his work with anti-matter, but she doesn't know who he is , and thinks he is Doom's intern\n\nJohnny sneaks into he ship and hides in a crate as he also wants to go to space. The crew eventually come in later. Ben puts a picture of Captain America up on the walls, to which Doom mocks him for believing in the lies of the tale of Captain America. Ben moves towards Doom, but is stopped by Reed. They fly up to space and pass by the moon. Ben tells Doom he saw a video on the internet about super-powered humans living on the blue area of the moon. Doom mocks Ben again.\n\nThey eventually reach the cosmic radiation. Reed is shocked at how much energy it is giving off. Johnny jumps out of the crate, and Sue berates him. Franklin Storm tells them to continue the mission even though Johnny is there. Doom tells Reed he is going to now use the favor Reed owes him. Doom pulls out his Tesseract replica, and tells Reed to fly the ship as close as he can to the Cosmic Field. Franklin Storm tells them not to do it. Doom turns on his device anyways. The blue light of the replica begins to flicker violently before turning green(space stone turning into time stone). The cosmic field engulfs the ship, and communication is lost. Franklin Storm, thinking both of his kids died, separates himself from the world, and moves to the forests.\n\nThe ship reappears in the future. Around the time of the most recent movie released by marvel studios (Infinity War Part 1 or captain marvel maybe). Johnny is on fire, Ben has turned to rock, Reed's body is stretching all around, Sue disappears and reappears, and Doom feels as though his face is being burnt. They crash land on an abandoned town in Latveria. Doom runs out hiding his face with his father's blanket. Doom runs into one of the houses and finds bandages and wraps it around his head completely covering it. He finds rope to tie his father's blanket around his shoulders.\n\nThe crew crash on Latveria. They all get out of the ship and are unsure where they are. They are shocked at how Ben looks. Only Doom knows where they are, but he ran off. Moloids being to come out of the ground. Ben knows they are not friendly, and rushes them. Ben fights them and is able to take out a lot of Moloids, but they keep coming. Reed grabs Sue and Johnny and pulls them all on top of a truck. Johnny says he would rather fight, and focuses on releasing his power. He flames on and goes to help Ben. Sue tells Reed to fight, but Reed says he isn't much of a fighter. A moloid comes towards them and Reed is able to stretch a gigantic fist and knock the Moloid out. Reed goes and helps Ben and Johnny, and Sue protects them with shields. Doom, eventually comes out and creates a ball of energy which sends energy all around hitting all the moloids. They all retreat.\nJohnny flies around before landing. He picks up an old newspaper showing Captain America and Tony Stark after they have defeated the Chitauri. The headline reads Tony Stark and the Avengers save New York from aliens. Ben says the world has gotten really weird since they have been gone. Reed sees the title of the newspaper as the Hassenstadt Tribune. Reed asks if this was the Capital of Doom's home country Latveria, and Doom says it is. Johnny says he's never heard of Latveria, and Doom replies that Latverians are doing their jobs then.\n\nThe crew begin to walk together in hopes of find someone to help them out. Johnny starts rambling on about what to name the group. He names a few things before saying the Fantastic 5. Ben tells him to stop as all those names are cliche nonsesne. The Latverian army helicoptors arrive where they are. Soldiers come out and point all their guns at them. Doom teleports away and leaves the group. Johnny jokes that the Fantastic 5 just became the Fantstic 4.\n\nThe army take the Fantastic 4 with them. Doom goes back to his old home. His house is in ruins with trash everywhere. Doom goes into the shed outside. Doom tries his best to focus all his mind on the door. Doom puts his hands out and spins them in a circular motion towards the door. A secret door of magic opens up leading to Doom's mother's old hideout. Doom goes in to find his father's old technology, and his mother's magic items. He finds a wooden mask that belonged to his mother. Doom puts it on. Doom finds his mother's diary and reads it.\nDoom uses his mother's writing to create a seal of a red hexagram shape of light on the ground. Doom steps on top of the hexagram and is transported the realm of Mephisto. Doom finds Mephisto, and tells Mephisto to free his mother's soul. Mephisto tells Doom he should be thankful for Mephisto's service, as it is the reason Doom turned out the way he was. Doom tells Mephisto that Mephisto lied to his mother on the deal. Doom's mother was given absolute control of her full magical powers, but also gave her a cancer that spread throughout her body eventually killing her. Mephisto laughs, and says there is always a catch to his deals. Doom sends hundreds of beams of energy towards Mephisto, but he deflects all of them. Mephisto strikes Doom down with one strike. Mephisto tells Doom he pities Doom, and tells him Doom he will give Doom freedom once a year to come to Mephisto's realm and fight him. If doom wins, then Mephisto will free Doom's mother's soul. Doom gets sent flying out of the realm, and lands on the ground outside the shed. Doom goes back into the shed, and creates his armor and turns his mother's wooden mask into a metal mask. Doom's quest for ultimate power had now been realized.\n\nCut back to the F4. The Latverian Army General interrogate them asking if they are Avengers. One of the soldiers says they apparently call themselves the Fantastic Four, and Ben tells them they never agreed to that. The General tells them to imprison them, as they are Americans, and no outsiders are welcome in Latveria. Reed goes on to say he knows what might be causing the moloids to spring up. The general listens. Reed pulls out a pocket size device, and turns it on. The device turns into Herbie. Reed tells Herbie to check for any strange frequencies that maybe causing interference. Herbie scans and says there are really low frequency sound waves coming from underneath the city. Reed then goes on to tell them of Harvey Elder otherwise known as the Mole Man for his peculiar appearance. Reed tells them he can help them with the Moloid Infestation if they help the F4 go home. They army agree, but tell the F4 they can't tell anyone of Latveria. They all agree.\n\nValeria eventually finds Doom at Doom's old residence. She checks up on the house every once in a while to make sure the shed doesn't get destroyed. She finds a badly injured Doom working on doombots outside the shed. Doom is happy to see her. She tells Doom about the Moloids. Doom tells her he will save Latveria, and she doesn't believe him, as he is severely injured. Doom goes through his mother's spells trying to find a spell which would heal his wounds. It takes him a few days but eventually he finds one, and heals himself. He puts his armor on with Valeria's help, and turns his Doombots and other robots on. Valeria tells Doom Hassenstadt is the only remaining city standing, and everyone in Latveria is there.\n\nEventually Reed is able to create a device using his and Doom's work on Anti-Matter and Wormholes. The device is able to send anything within it's path to the negative zone. The F4 go down underground to Subterranea to find the Mole Man. Eventually they find the Mole Man. The Mole Man is using his staff to send low frequency sound waves out and causing the mole people to attack Latveria. The Mole Man turns it on to max power, Moloids begin to spring Hassenstadt. The Latverian Army attempts to defend thier city. Mole Man summons Giganto to fight off the F4.\n\nMost of the Latverian army is defeated by the moloids. The civilian men of Latveria realize they are the last hope, and pick up whatever weapons they have. They take to the streets to begin battle. Borris leads the charge. A moloid attacks Borris and is about to kill him before Doom arrives crashing on the streets and sending moloids flying back. Doom picks up Borris who realizes who Doom is with an instant. Doom teleports to all the Moloids and begins to fight them. There are thousands of moloids around Doom. Doom is able to fight them all off using energy blasts, magic, and his various missiles, grenades, and other weaponry, but they come at him one after another. Borris tells the men that Doom is the one who they all saw in their dreams. The one who will save latveria. All the men get riled up and they all attack the moloids. Doom summons his robots to come to aid.\n\nEventually the F4 are able to subdue Giganto. Ben chases Mole man down, and knocks him out with one punch. They pick up the staff and Reed tells them his device may end up destroying them all if it doesn't work properly. Sue gets mad at Reed, but holds his hand and tells him to turn it on and get rid of the Staff. Reed turns it on and they throw the staff in. His device then explodes, and they are sent flying. All the moloids on he surface begin fleeing back to the underground, as all the Latverians take a knee and bow to Doom.\n\nThe Latverian general thanks the F4, and tells them the Latverian people have given all the credit to Dr. Doom, and do not even know of the F4's existence. They are given a plane to leave back home. Doom tells Reed he is going to stay. They shake hands and and Reed Leaves. The end shows Doom walking into the castle of the king, as all guards just take a knee, bow, and let him go through every door as if it was his castle. Doom eventually reaches the king's castle, and asks why the king could not have killed his father and persecuted his mother in person instead of sending guards to do it. The king is in so much fear he can't even say anything. Doom grabs the king by the throat and chokes him to death. Doom then walks out of the Balcony as thousands of Latverians stand outside cheering and screaming \"ALL HAIL DOOM\".\n\nEnding Credit Scene Silver Surfer flys through space and eventually reaches the Earth's Moon. Sufer talks to Uatu the Watcher and tells him Galactus is coming. Uatu tells him the humans are not ready, and they aren't even able to leave the planet yet. Surfer tells him he feels the pain of Uatu as his planet was once threatened with Galactus's hunger. Surfer tells him he will leave a source of his Power Cosmic energy near the Earth, and hopes the humans can use it properly. Surfer blasts a field of Power Cosmic Energy in space. The watcher thanks Surfer for this, even though surfer is betraying Galactus. Surfer then flies off.",

By tying tuition costs of certain institutions to the minimum wage, you could control/correct undue cost inflation of higher education.\n\nSay something like a semester's tuition at CC is capped at 400x the minimum wage and a public 4 year uni is 600x the min wage.

I noticed how ridiculously pricey a funeral is. 20k+ just for dying and leaving it to your kids to deal with. \n\nThis idea stems from noticing that weddings have a photo booth where you can take pics to take home with you and also to give to the couple getting married. These booths rent for $500+ for a night.\n\nNow we know weddings and funerals are a staple business in life and its one of those really expensive events that you don't really care about expenses too much. \n\nNow what if you took that photo booth idea to a funeral. Obviously its not a happy occasion to be taking funny photos. But it would be an amazing memory for those that attend to record an audio/video about the deceased person. There will have to have some type of moderator to reduce people from going over their time. \n\nI think people will pay 1k+ to have something like this easily. I know I would and have it hosted online somewhere and on the grave stone. A persistent data storage without fees would be good. ",

            "selftext": " I'm thinking of a mashup of Wikipedia, Reddit and Kickstarter to create A non-profit or nominally profitable crowdrun site for collecting and developing hypothesis. \n\n**The vision is**:\n\nAn individual would post a hypothesis, it would be curated via voting and modding akin to reddit. The difference is that upon voting you are invited to add to the proposal of the hypothesis. (A la wikipedia) You can then cite research papers and add information on why the hypothesis is viable and not viable. In addition methods of exploring the hypothesis will be discussed. Upon voting you will also be able to donate some amount of money towards the hypothesis. Once a hypothesis reaches a threshold of funding and clarity of purpose, it will be made accessible or pitched to groups in Academia who might have the facilities and technical expertise to get it done. (It saves them time and gives them money! They should be interested...)\n\n**Why do this?**:\nI think all that separates a member of the public from a Ph.D student or professor in academia is the amount of relevant literature read, contacts, access to facilities and lab skills. I think by crowdsourcing literature reviews and hypotheses and providing funding, we can further open up the insulated regions of academia and research to the public. It will give greater engagement and open reporting of scientific data and reduce dependence on Agencies. It also lets the public experience the trials of science, be it the common failure of hypothesis or the success.\n\nThe idea would target the involvement of the layperson with serious interest in science and people already in academia.\n\n*Thanks for reading this far.*\nObviously many things have to be fleshed out, and implemented. This is where I'm turning to you. Lets hear your take on things. It'd also be great if we can form some sort of serious team to work towards this in our free time (PM if you're interested). I am a PhD. student in Houston and if we can get somewhere with this, I can approach and pitch it to people who could help us get it off the ground faster. It'd also be great to hear from Programmers and project managers on their views on what would be required to make this feasible.\n\nThis is my first post and first attempt at communicating with a crowd. I look forward to seeing your responses.\n\nThanks.\n*And_Being*",

As you fire gravity brings the rounds sliding down the magazine ramp, feeding into the custom magazine which fits the firearm.\n\nFor the video you'll have to stand in one place; can't exactly be walking around with an 80 foot ramp magazine.  \n\nFire off like ten thousand rounds with 1 trigger pull.

            "selftext": "Currently in the US, our only real jobs and training programs of any note are through the US Military. It trains hundreds of thousands every year, provides them with a guaranteed job, and years of work experience with the option to quit or continue until retirement. Unfortunately, this program is only available for those who wish to be part of an organization whose mission is to kill or be killed. I think that this is a poor system that does not encourage the involvement of many people in our country. \n\nMy idea is to expand the ASVAB, or Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery, to include the entire Federal Government. Perhaps rename it FSVAB for Federal Services. With this expansion it would operate much the same as the military side, with job openings, training qualifications, and being placed where needed by the Federal Government. So for instance, you want to work in the National Parks. So you would contact the National Park Service ,within the Department of the Interior, and sign up to take the aptitude test. Then with the score you would find out what jobs you qualify for and what jobs are currently available within the NPS at that time, at the same time you could just go as an undecided that will take whatever comes up after initial training. You then have to sign up for a set number of years (2,4,6) of work depending on your job choice, similar to how the military operates. After signing the contract, you leave for a central training school for your job, perhaps even have a mixed course that teaches necessary social skills that military people learn in basic training like physical training, budgeting, wearing a work uniform, the history of the service that you joined, etc. After graduation you are sent to where you are needed and provided a basic housing in a federal facility. \n\nAll in all, this could be a huge boon for the country as we will gain a large group of trained and experienced workers that can be used to improve our country with direct action within our borders. Just think of what could happen if Congressional districts stopped fighting to keep a Battle Tank factory open that produces tanks that the DoD doesn't want. Instead they fight to keep a solar panel factory open so that all Federal Buildings in the Sunbelt use renewable energy that are installed by the Federal workers from this program. Lower costs and better long term value. \n\nAs an added bonus, everyone who gives years of their lives to their fellow citizens are given Veteran status with access to the VA programs as well as VA hospitals. You shouldn't be devalued just because you don't want to kill people, giving service is giving service. ",

People post suggestions in the relevant sub and/or forum and the community decides where it goes.  Top of the charity page for past two weeks gets the reward. Top of the month in the other two would be rewarded. Page would obviously be moderated to prevent abuse.\n\nThe money would come from a subscription of one dollar a week with the option to give more but defaulting at one dollar so as to attract a viral marketing campaign.  I truly believe the common man has it in his heart to give 1 dollar a week to the betterment of our species especially if they get to see how much was going out a month. .  If it hit facebook as well as other social medias, it could potentially make a large difference.\n\n\nI believe in this, and I'm going to pursue it becoming a thing, curious of suggestions or advice.\n\n",

            "selftext": "WARNING: Large Wall of Text Incoming, but I ask for someone to give this a read, it may be worth it!\nGreetings Reddit! I have been researching Alzheimer's for about 2 years in depth, doing very basic research due to lack of funds and not being in a graduate program. I asked a small question to some of my university professors, looked up as much as I could in relation to what I am interested in, and found nothing in terms of research focusing on this idea. I guess I am seeking some type of validation on my theory, or someone to actually want to help me study this. What I am proposing is Alzheimer's could be caused by pH issue with cerebrospinal-fluid and that it could be a metastatic brain disease. I explain the basics in depth, and tie it all together to make this an idea. I did not do any scientific test directly related to this theory, and this is purely inferential based on facts. This puzzle is seriously one of my brainchildren. What is posted below is a paper I wrote for an assignment, and I would like to make it better at some point. There will be errors in grammar most likely, and the apa formatting will be off.\n\nAlzheimer\u2019s Disease \n\nEtiological research of illness and ailments in elderly individuals seems to be a rising interest as the human lifespan is extended via groundbreaking medical research and development. However, there is one recurring ailment in gerontology studies that seems to elude researchers on its etiology and remains a problem that needs to be solved in order to preserve other lives in the future. Although an abundance of stimulating and complex research has been conducted in the past and is being conducted presently, there still lacks a definitive cause of crippling effects of Alzheimer\u2019s Disease. As a researcher of this impairing onset and terminal illness, it is appalling to see the apparent lack of empirical research of the basic biological components of this disease. Alzheimer\u2019s Disease impairs cognitive and physiological functions that may have some aspects of its etiology involving basic biological and neurological concepts that are not being researched. Due to this lack of research, one can see that there are potential flaws in modern research of Alzheimer\u2019s as there seems to be no focus on the basic fundamentals of biology, neurology, and physiology that may aid in the onset of this disease.\n\nPrior to the explanation of the theory of Alzheimer\u2019s potentially true etiology, one must resort to understanding the basics of biology and its effects on physiological functions. This is in reference to the chemical components of proteins and the relation enzymes, with a relearning of the effects of pH and temperature on these key components. Proteins are one of the sources of energy utilized by living organisms in order to accomplish enzymatic reactions within an organic environment. Enzymes are required in order to break down specific macromolecule substrates in order to conduct an enzymatic chemical reaction and conversely used to build up other substrates for the use of another function within an organism (Reece, 67). However, both proteins and enzymes are susceptible to the process of being broken down, known as denaturation, when there is a fluctuation of pH or temperature. The process of denaturation can occur at extreme changes, whereas minor changes may elicit an increase of enzymatic activity or a decrease, depending on the circumstance. However, when a protein molecule denatures, its structure and composition can be modified into varying ways which may lead to improper function and breakdown within the organism.\n\nWithin this realm of denaturation, the organic chemical composition of a basic protein molecule needs to be recalled as well in order to compound the concepts for this theory. Most macromolecules consist of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, whereas protein contains the additional elements of nitrogen and sulfur in its chemical makeup (Alberts, et al. 2002). For a moment, consider the nitrogen cycle and its detrimental effects within environments, such as an aquarium for example. If the nitrate or nitrite buildup within the aquarium is too high, then the environment\u2019s pH becomes too basic or too acidic, killing off the fish inside and causing an algal bloom. Within the body, it is known that the kidneys primarily support the maintenance of pH within the body, thus controlling the buildup of nitrogen by eliminating it within human waste. Considering all of these concepts at hand, the attention must shift to one of the most important concentration of protein mass which is the brain and its components that assist in the functioning of the human body. As mentioned earlier, enzymes are utilized to break down molecules in order to be utilized in other enzymatic reactions within the body. These components travel through the bloodstream and inevitably lead to the brain, where it must pass through the blood-brain barrier in order for the substrate to be utilized for functions within the brain. The blood-brain barrier serves as a regulator and prevents certain chemicals from reaching the brain in order to prevent disruption of transmissions within the nervous system (Carlson, 39-40). As the chemicals and substrates are absorbed for use in the brain, these components travel with the aid of cerebrospinal fluid that the surrounds much of the nervous system.\n\nCerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is the primary constituent of this theory of how Alzheimer\u2019s may be caused and how it spreads to other important functional areas of the brain. CSF is extracted from blood and produced by what is known as the choroid plexus which is another key addition to this theory. The choroid plexus has a location within each of the four ventricles of the brain and assists in the production, circulation, and reabsorption of CSF within the brain (Carlson 72-73). Where the choroid plexus is located has importance with its relation to Alzheimer\u2019s disease, as the third and fourth ventricle have an interesting potential connection to the symptoms of onset for Alzheimer\u2019s.\nTaking a step away from the physiology of key structures of the brain, consider one must be able to connect the relationship between the anatomy and physiology to the onset of symptoms for Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Early symptoms typically involved a progressive loss of cognitive function, such as poor judgment and emotional instability, and declining ability to remember things. As Alzheimer\u2019s progresses, these symptoms begin to worsen and other symptoms begin to arise such as loss of ability to perform daily activities, inappropriate impulses of emotions, and many other physical symptoms (Rogers, 2008). The neuronal symptoms that coincide should be noted as well, as they are further additions to the progression of Alzheimer\u2019s symptoms and the degradation of cognitive functions. This process occurs at a neuronal level, where a protein known as tau begins to attach to other molecules with a phosphate molecule, and within a brain with Alzheimer\u2019s disease, numerous phosphate molecules exist and more binding occurs. The excessive binding to multiple phosphate molecules, referred to as hyperphosphorylation, is the cause of the tangles, which inevitably dismantle the synaptic transportation systems within the neurons and ceasing communication between the nerve cells. As Alzheimer\u2019s progresses, these intra-neuronal connections and communications continue to degrade, thus killing more neurons off and causing the brain to shrink (Rogers, 2008). This leads to the final simplistic construct that must be reviewed which is the basic structures and functions of a neuron, following with their relation to the onset and decline of brain activity.\n\nA neuron is a fundamental piece of the nervous system as it is the key to the functions of everything within body and serves as the communication link from the brain to the rest of the body. The basic structure of a neuron consists of dendrites, soma, axon, myelin sheath, and terminal buttons which all have important role in the function of the entire neuron and communication between neurons. Impulses are received by the dendrites, transfer down the axon, which is sped up or slowed down depending on the presence of myelin sheath, and through the terminal buttons that release a neurotransmitter. If an axon is coated with a myelin sheath, then an impulse is carried faster down the axon versus a non-myelinated axon where the impulse moves at a slower speed (Carlson, 2014). These basics are applicable to the theory that is going to be elaborated on momentarily, as they can be a potential reason for a fluctuation within pH due to a nitrogenous spike.\n\nWith all of the fundamental concepts at hand and the interrelationship between each, it would be presumptuous that someone could see that all of this concepts have a proper relationship to the possible etiology of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. However, this is where the problem lies, as there is very little research on the essential basics and their relationship with one another. According to Nathalie Strazielle and Jean-Francois Ghersi-Egea, who studied the entirety of the physiological function, anatomy, and connections with the choroid plexus, identified that there is indeed a relationship with the choroid plexus and Alzheimer\u2019s. Strazielle and Ghersi-Egea explain that the choroid plexus is a key aggregate in lesions and beta-amyloid deposits within the brain of an individual with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. With this in mind, it would seem like Alzheimer\u2019s could essentially be a metastatic disease, transferring beta-amyloid to different locations within the brain. This analogy can relate to a very recent study conducted by Antoine Louveau, Jonathan Kipnis, and Tajie Harris on brain immunology, which identified a lymphatic system for the central nervous system. According to Dr. Kipnis, these vessels could be a factor in the removal of the plaque buildup within the brain and are not being functioning properly in order to remove the proteins within a brain with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. In accordance to their research findings, Alzheimer\u2019s could also have a potentiality to an autoimmune response, which explains the buildup of beta-amyloid plaque rather than the elimination of the plaque (Barney).\n\nAlthough the aforementioned research is beneficial to potentially finding the etiology of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, there still lacks research and the relationship within the components of the following theory. The first question to pose is, what is the pH of cerebrospinal fluid because if neuronal components of the brain are mostly protein molecules, then any fluctuation of the pH values could have an effect on the buildup of beta-amyloid. Recall, if an enzyme denatures, its properties as well as function could change, leading to the possibility that enzymes within the ventricles near the choroid plexus could be altered in such a way that increases the buildup of beta-amyloid proteins and plaque. If neuronal connections are broken down due to a pH fluctuation and hyperphosphorylation occurs, which leads to the tangling of neurons and inevitable death of the cell, the cell should be eliminated. However, if the cell is made of protein, and is not eliminated by a neuronal lysosome, then the cell should decompose within the CSF. If too many neurons die without being destroyed by lysosomes, then there should be a nitrogenous buildup within the CSF, thus causing a spike in the ph. A spike in the pH could alter the choroid plexus due to an enzyme that is not properly functioning because it cannot breakdown a byproduct of beta-amyloid, or the fluctuation caused a denaturation of the enzymes within the choroid plexus that reabsorb CSF. Further recall the onset of symptoms, and the location of each ventricle because this is also related to the causation. Theoretically speaking, if a malfunction occurred in the reabsorption process of the third or fourth ventricle\u2019s choroid plexus, then it would more than likely proceed to produce an enzyme of slight increase of pH within the CSF. If the fourth ventricle is effected, consider its location caudal to the hippocampus, where memories are one of the first symptoms that are effected. Furthermore, consider the location of the third ventricle, dorsal to the prefrontal cortex where emotional regulation resides and near the portion of the brain where judgement can be impaired. Coincidentally, if Alzheimer\u2019s disease progresses to more serious stages, speech, physical, and various other symptoms can occur, which are possibly connection to malfunctions with the lateral ventricles. This connects to the concept stated for a brief moment earlier, with the concept that perhaps Alzheimer\u2019s could be a metastatic disease, which impairs the functioning of the choroid plexus within the ventricles of the brain. In summary, this theory relies on an understanding of how something as basic as pH could have such an effect on the rest of the brain and there is no known empirical evidence in existence to disprove this theory.\n\nAlthough researchers are still unraveling new secrets to how the brain works, some very basic and core concepts of biology, physiology, and neurology need to be considered as the first things to test. Alzheimer\u2019s disease is one particular interesting ailment that should be studied more, given these very basic connections and logical foundations mentioned above. Although newer research is proving to be promising, in the hopes for uncovering the definitive etiology of Alzheimer\u2019s, there are still basic fundamentals that have not been tested or considered for potential causes. By no means is the aforementioned theory a conclusive answer to the question of what causes Alzheimer\u2019s, but it is definitely a step in the correct direction. The problem with the research in the realm of Alzheimer\u2019s disease starts with at least having research published in regards to the basics of pH of CSF in the brain and how it effects the probable onset of the disease, yes it does not seem to exist. Perhaps studying the theory of pH and the malfunction of the choroid plexus will be the initiative needed in order to correctly discover the cause of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. \n\nReferences \n\nAlberts B, Johnson A, Lewis J, et al.

Don't put them directly on your roof because it will absorb heat and you'll need a typical amount of A/C.  Reduce the need for A/C by blocking the sun with solar panels off of your house.\n\nInstead of a large continuous panel of solar cells, have individual squares a few feet above or next to your house.  This way, if its extremely windy, you can switch them into wind turbine mode where they flip into a vertical position and spin with the wind.  \n\nIf a hurricane or tornado is coming they'll have a Safe mode so they don't get destroyed by the gusts of wind.  \n\nI don't know how any of this would work but I think its an idea that is worth thinking about.

So it might say \"Usually goes to <place name> every Thursday at 8pm.\"\n\n- a chrome web extension that could tell you if the USB-C cable that you want to buy on amazon is safe or not (based on the information from the google engineer, http://gizmodo.com/a-google-engineer-is-publicly-shaming-crappy-usb-c-cabl-1742719818)\n\n\n- an app that would allow you to plan a vacation/trip and let you know if the weather will be poor during any of the days you are going on vacation\n\n- extremely low-cost cellular chips which transmit a little bit of data (cheap like $1, but only transmits a few bytes of data like a fitness tracker.) Might require a cell subscription (maybe get a deal with the cell providers?)\n\n- an app to make offsite backups really really easy via sending data to the other computer via an intermediate server. Would encrypt data prior to transfer. Just plug in your hard drive in the offsite location and click a few buttons. Different from Dropbox because it wouldn't save the data to the intermediate server, therefore you would not have to pay for a recurring subscription.\n\n- an app that would know when is the best time to go on screensaver mode based on your previous actions (maybe use machine learning)\n\n- an app to warn you if making a purchase would result in your bills not being paid (i.e a monthly subscription to Netflix, which if it goes through on a certain month, would cause you not to have enough money for rent.) Would have to have access to all financial transactions (like Mint.)\n\n- an app that could tell what song you are listening to via Shazam, and send it to last.fm, regardless if the app supports last.fm and/or Shazam\n\n- an app that would easily allow IoT devices to upload data (to a temporary server) to save for a week or so until the developer can get to download it at a later time\n\n- a cheaper version of this app (https://nugget.one/, an app where people can post their ideas that they want and people can make them.)",

            "selftext": "I heard an NPR segment this morning about a group of protesters gathered in my local town square to protest the potential repeal of the ACA. However, the protest didn't have a very large turnout. A group of ~30 people would never have an impact on a country wide controversial issue I thought, they need more people! That made me think, how do these events gather people for their cause anyway?\n\nI was thinking it would be cool to make a site that would essentially be the \"kickstarter of activism campaigns\". You post the cause, get backers, decide a location, get funding if necessary, and if you reach your goals then your protest/rally/march/etc. is a go! That way you never have to worry about showing up on the day and be the only one picketing. It would also be a good place for others to browse and find out issues in the community others may not have known about.\n\nIs this already done? (Other than through facebook pages) If not would it be a worthy endeavor?",

            "selftext": "Many of our sewers are in terrible shape. Also, pooping and peeing in potable (fresh, drinkable) water is a terrible idea. Not only does it waste VERY valuable water, but it's unnecessary. Plus, all the energy and resources that go into then separating the water from the waste, and cleaning it, etc. Compost toilets already exist, but as of right now it is inconvenient to own one. At the same time, there are some safety issues involved with composting human waste.\n\nWe could solve these issues on a large scale if a business or  municipality would offer a service where a resident could have their toilet replaced by a composting toilet. Then, much like a garbage truck, the service would pick up the waste container once full, and drop off a clean one. They could then take all the waste collected from residents and compost it safely in a facility where the temperature can be monitored to ensure any harmful bacteria is killed in the process. Then, they could sell this compost back to consumers, farmers, etc.\n\nI've been thinking about this for a while, and it seems to me to be a legitimate alternative to our ageing sewer systems. (Obviously they would still be used for sinks/bathtubs, etc.) But I think it addresses many other issues as well. \n\nLet me know your thoughts!",

Toss out electoral votes,\u00a0 individual votes are all that matters.\u00a0 This branch of government would be the only ones able to vote for president, and be paid upon doing so and/or recieve benifits for doing so. Perhaps each consecutive year comes with new bonuses? \nThey would also have a say in every major law, especially those that define what it means to be criminal, that passes on the federal level and within their respective states and are each paid for this action. It would be illegal for any \"secret meetings\" or under the table deals to exist in voting,\u00a0 or to create fraudulent voting punishable harshly so that it is heavily discouraged...yet forgiving as well so as not to completely distroy a persons life,\u00a0 only make it harder or more challeging via penalties for a certain amount of time.\u00a0Thats confusing i know but important.\n This branch of government would aim to give the people voice and incentive for using it, with a heavy emphisis on countering corruption. It would be made up of the largest quantity of people of any branch of government, attempting to include everyone (everyone is a key word) as non judgmentally yet as cautiously as possible so we can truely and clearly hear what the people want,\u00a0 and think and need. \n\nNow, it's your turn to tell me why I'm dumb.\n\nP.S: Im a bit stoned and a little drunk so sorry if this is (most likely) full of \"plot holes\".
