However what i am wondering is if you separate the voting into homerooms where the winner of the class counts as 1 vote similar to an electoral college without the population determining the worth of the vote, if that could deter the population contest that only vote for their friend. would this idea work in diversifying the votes and possibly allow the election of a more fitting individual, or would the same outcome from a majority vote in the grade still occur.

            "selftext": "There are several game mechanics in my DropZap World game that I believe to be original with respect to color matching gameplay. I will describe these below.\n\nI will assume familiarity with match 3 games such as Candy Crush Saga but not familiarity with my earlier DropZap and DropZap 2 games. \n\nThis video should make the description below more clear: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8fI1LkDZxc\n\n**Basic Gameplay**\n\nTo pass a level, you will need to achieve the goal specified, which is currently one of two types: destroy all the foreground square pieces or destroy all the background lit squares. More on this later.\n\nNow, as the name \u201cDropZap World\u201d hints, gameplay consists of circle pieces *dropping* and *zapping*. \n\nSuppose the current drop piece is red and you choose to drop it in the second column of the grid. This piece would fire its red lasers in eight directions when it lands on top of another piece (of any color) or at the bottom of the grid.\n\nLasers affect pieces of the same color but simply go through (plain) pieces of different colors without affecting them in any way.\n\nReturning to our example, when the red drop piece lands:\n\n* Red pieces in the same row or column as this piece are destroyed.\n\n* Red pieces in one of the two diagonals containing this piece are *mutated*.\n\nMutation transforms pieces through the following cycle:\n\n* plain piece to \u201cbackslash\u201d or \u201cforward slash\u201d mirror piece depending on whether the laser hitting it is \u201cbackslash\u201d or \u201cforward slash\u201d, respectively.\n\n* mirror piece to splitter piece\n\n* splitter piece to blocker piece\n\n* blocker piece to plain piece\n\nAfter the destruction and/or mutation step, pieces may drop and thus an elaborate chain reaction could form using the rules above.\n\n**Passing levels**\n\nAs mentioned above, to pass a level, you will need to achieve the goal specified, which is currently one of two types: destroy all the foreground square pieces or destroy all the background lit squares.\n\nTo destroy a foreground square, you will need to destroy a circle piece adjacent to it.\n\nTo destroy a background lit square, there must not already be a foreground square piece on top of it. If that is the case, then you can destroy a circle on top or adjacent to it to destroy the lit square.\n\n**Earning stars through laser art.**\n\nWhen you pass a level, you earn zero to three stars depending on the art generated from your gameplay.\n\nIn particular, laser art snapshots are automatically taken from your chain reactions. There are at most six art snapshots shown at any time and a better looking laser art snapshot will replace an existing one.\n\nWhen you pass a level, you earn zero to three stars based on the quality of (up to six) art snapshots currently shown at the end of the game.\n\n**Using laser art to make \u201cart moves\u201d**\n\nLaser art snapshots can be used to make art moves. Art moves are only available when there are no normal moves available because there is no space in the grid where you can drop the drop piece. \n\nTo make an art move, select one of the art snapshots. You will then see a preview in the main grid where all the firing pieces in the art snapshot fire in the main grid. You could then confirm the art move and have the \u201czap\u201d step proceed as is shown in the preview (possibly resulting in an elaborate chain reaction) or you could preview another art move.\n\n**Beta testing on iOS and/or tvOS**\n\nIf you would like to beta test DropZap World on iOS and/or tvOS, please contact me via PM or email to a.michail@me.com.\n\n**Questions**\n\nSo what do you think of these game mechanics? Would you play this game? Do you think it would have popular appeal? How can I make it more accessible to people familiar with modern match 3 games?",

            "selftext": "The idea is that some methane leaks during oil production (and in other industries) but it is not worth it to those industries to collect it. Instead they let it leak off into the atmosphere. This has indirect costs down the road to society such as damage from flooding, increased storms, etc. The idea is that these costs would be estimated and converted into a cost per unit of methane. The government would then buy methane if the market price was below this level and sell if it's above. The increased price encourages companies to collect more of the otherwise wasted gas for sale thereby reducing the problems caused by it's pollution. Methane is useful and the sell off helps fund the program.\n\nApologies if this is too well known to be interesting: it just occurred to me on the way home. It seems to be a form of environmental Price Support, but I hadn't heard of this variant before.",

If my twin bought something that fit them, they would just tell me the sku # of the product, and I could order it online with a pretty high degree of confidence that it would fit.\n\nSince I don't have a twin, I think the next best thing would be another person that happens to have the exact same body size as me would do.  I have been trying to think of a way to find that person, and I think it comes down to fit and style.  Say I find a person who likes Skinny Jeans, and can fit perfectly into Red Pants.  If I happened to have that exact same pair of Red Pants, and they fit me perfectly too (without being altered), I'd say we are a pretty close match.  What could happen is if I had a pair of Blue Pants (also skinny jeans) that also fit me perfectly, there would be a pretty good chance I could tell the other person the SKU, and the Blue Pants would fit them too.\n\nWonder if clothing companies are keeping lists of who bought  SKU numbers of clothes that fit perfectly unaltered... it seems like there would be a good opportunity to make online clothes shopping smarter.

            "selftext": "[\"Missed connections\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missed_connection) refers to a type of internet phenomenon where it becomes possible to get in contact with a complete stranger who you earlier noticed and were attracted to at a particular place and time by making a post on a forum (like craigslist) describing that individual and hoping that they will, by chance, stumble upon your post.  Of course it never works because very few people actually browse craigslist, let alone the missed connections section of craigslist.  \n\nMatch.com now has a missed connections feature, but it only works for people who have an account on match.com and enroll into the service, and it's not exactly for \"missed connections\" because it just tells you what other match.com members were in a particular area at the same time you were, regardless of whether you noticed them or not.\n\nWhat I was thinking for facebook would work like this:  You have a missed connection (you notice someone attractive but for whatever reason are unable to approach them in person), and once you realize the opportunity has passed you note the location and exact time you saw this person.  Because so many people have facebook accounts and have the app on their phone, there's a fair chance they have the app running, making it possible for facebook to store their location history.  So you describe to facebook the exact time and place of the missed connection, as well as the sex of the person, hair color, height, weight, etc. (even if they don't provide some of this info, facebook's algorithms can probably still detect it from analyzing photos). Facebook then determines if there is any match between its members and the info you provide and also verifies that you were actually in the same location at the same time, and if there is a match it sends a message to that person with a link to your profile.  If the person is interested they can then contact you back.  If they aren't interested then you will never know whether facebook identified your missed connection or not.  \n\nIt would protect privacy and at the same time become the first service that actually connects people who had missed connections.",

            "selftext": "I was watching a documentary about wolves in Yellowstone, and I had a crazy idea. \n\nWhat if we reintroduced Cheetahs to North America?\n\nIt's not really as crazy as it first appears. First, cheetahs wouldn't truly be an invasive species: they evolved in North America, only going extinct there about 12,000 years ago. Imagine if we had a north america where wolves went extinct 12,000 years ago. As we learned from Yellowstone, apex predators have an enormous and healthy balancing effect on their ecosystems. People would freak about about introducing wolves, but this is their natural habitat, and the ecosystem functions better with them. Why not cheetahs then too?\n\nPronghorn antelope are the fastest herbivores on the planet. They can run up to 55 miles per hour. There are currently no predators in North America that can come remotely close to this speed! They evolved to run this fast to escape from north american cheetahs, which no longer exist.  \n\nReintroducing wolves to Yellowstone helped its ecosystem return to a healthier, more natural state. They influenced the behavior of deer and elk in a way that helped the plants grow, reshaped riverbeds, led to more hawks and other birds (more bugs from the more diverse plant life), and even led to beavers returning to the area. Restoring another apex predator, the cheetah, to its natural place would likely have similar effects on other ecosystems in north america.",

People who just want to be heard. We can skype, they can talk as much as they want about anything they want. Talk about how mad you are about politics, or your boss, or that jerk that cut in front of you at the movie, or how depression has affected your life, or even talk about how much you've always loved music and that you write your own songs and hope to make it big someday. Whatever you want to talk about.\n\nI think it would be interesting to people to listen to real conversations, and it would be good for some people to be able to get things off their chest, the people who just need someone to vent to. \n\nOf course they would know that the conversation is recorded and would be posted online. \n_________________________________________________\n\nI love doing accents, I've made a few characters with different ones.

Adam Winrich mentioned the concept of a bullwhip made from recycled beach plastic some time ago on facebook, so I did some old fashioned google-fu and found plans to make a jig that makes string from plastic bottles, man it really works! Spending more than five dollars online just isnt worth it when all you need is a utility blade, some wood, and a saw, but more on that another time (i.e. the comments)... Anyways! I made the jig, made some \"string \" and it braids very well, and thats saying something considering I can only fully use my right hand lol So 6 plait seems to be bare minimum for smooth layering, also soda bottle plastic has the added benefit of hardening when blasted with a heat gun, so the base of the plaiting is fairly secured without needing to use a lot of tape, or any at all really. As always questions are encouraged and I have decided to go open-source with yall, since you're so wonderful! All my discoveries, data, and disease... DIAGRAMS!! will be shared with all of thee for the low cost of nothing. Because Adam told me to :)\n\np.s. 12 bottles = around 1000 feet of lace, at 80 odd cents per off- brand soda bottle, or free if you're a hippy like that",

As a few examples, Platinum, Gold, Silver and Copper could be the hot/popular girls (and have the appropriate hair colors); Helium would be a ditzy airhead; Silicon and Germanium would be computer geeks; Iron, Strontium and Tungsten would be the jocks; Aluminum and Chromium would be those guys who always work on their cars; Uranium would always be unstable and angry ... you get the idea. And they wouldn't all have to be students. Carbon could teach biology, Titanium could be the gym teacher, and Sodium could be the lunch lady. The physical forces might also play an administrative role, with Strong as the principle, Gravity as the VP, and Electromagnetism as the school counselor (you know, bringing the students together).\n\nIf anyone wants to run with this, be my guest.

Between different religions, this only becomes more and more serious.\n\nGiven the popularity of subreddits like r/Christianity , r/Judaism, r/atheism, and r/Islam , (plus all the ex subreddits and r/DebateReligion ), I believe there is room for such a sub on Reddit. \n\nGranted, some of this will depend upon the goodness of people and strong rules, but I believe it could be done and a valuable addition to Reddit.",

Can't be fission because of the inhumanity of such destructive potential) \n-bouyoncy of aircraft mostly supplied by helium. Additional lift and height/ thrust using turbo rotors\n- full compliment of drones and missiles, up to capacity. Should only be minimal crew capacity if at all (3-5 flight crew and engineer)\n-Ship would be protected by pack of air to air drones (1/3 capacity) along with four (mounted beneath) and one (mounted above) laser arrays and aegis defense systems used on Naval destroyers. Perhaps the mounting of two rail guns as well depending on weight beneath \n- ship would have immense destructive capacity. Compliment of many short range missiles and bombs, along with armed drones and even potentially kamikaze style robots. The undermoubted rail guns could be used for Ariel bombardment. \n\nTrue mobile unmanned relatively battlestation. Could be used to quell an entire city. Should be highly resistant to counterattack outside of large airforces because of the amount of drones. Could do intense damage to a city. Could also be potentially used for surgical strikes and subsequent domination of locations. Ground resistance would be almost impossible depending on the quality of drone technology and it would require a decent amount of air power or even missile attack to overcome. Some smaller drones could even be used to form an effective 'iron dome' around the craft and just kamikaze into any oncoming objects. \n\nI think the usa potentially could create something like this today, under war time conditions and with a lot of money devoted to the project.",

            "selftext": "I was watching Seinfeld the other day...\n\nI turned on the TV and the episode where George decides to do \"the opposite\" was on. It's a work of comedic genius, but then I got to thinking...\n\nWhat if George stumbled upon something *actually* genius? What if doing \"the opposite\" more often was the secret to solving problems?\n\n\nInversion\n---------\n\nCharlie Munger, philosopher investor and Warren Buffett's right-hand man, is famous for saying, \"invert, always invert.\" To make this more clear, ask yourself this question:\n\n> \"If I want something in my life, how would I go about NOT getting it?\"\n\nDo you ever try to solve a problem in your life, but the options seem endless? Even thinking about the problem freezes you up? That's because you haven't *inverted* the problem yet!\n\nFor example: imagine you want to get toned and have visible abs.  What would it take to achieve that?\n\nCrunches, squats, eating clean, going on a run...the list is endless.\n\nSo invert the question: *what activities would I have to do NOT to get that six pack?* \n\nEat chips, drink a pitcher of beer with friends, stay out and party, don't go to the gym, don't sweat every day...see the difference?\n\nYou *already know what you shouldn't do* and those activities come to mind much easier than the never-ending list of things you *should** do*\n\nEnter The \"Not To Do List\"\n--------------------------\n\nLet's look at another example from Johnny Carson, the great late night host, who during a commencement speech was asked to share some tips for happiness for the graduating class. \n\nHow could he answer that question?  It's subjective and broad.  But inversion loves broad questions! All you have to do is ask, \"What would make me the opposite of happy (miserable)?\"\n\nTo Johnny, that list was easier to describe to the students.  He gave these three suggestions:\n\n* Ingesting chemicals in an effort to alter mood or perception\n* Envy\n* Resentment\n\nIf we take his list and invert it one more time, we get his recipe for things to do for a happier life:\n\nDon't do drugs because they might be masking an underlying condition that should be addressed.\n\nInstead of being envious, default to being happy for those excel around you.\n\nInstead of feeling resentment, just move on. You can't change the past so you might as well focus on what you can control.\n\n[Navy Seal Jocko Willink](http://jockopodcast2.com/) has a saying that I love when he's faced with a bad situation. Whenever something bad happens, he says, \"Good.\" Then, he proceeds to look to what's next so he can move on with his life productively.  That's so much better than saying, \"Aww shit!\" and going down rabbit holes where he adds unnecessary self-doubt to his life.\n\nInvert, Damn It!\n----------------\n\nIf you have an open-ended question that's been stumping you, try inverting it. Think of how you might achieve the opposite result and then *don't do the things you come up with.*\n\nFor example, I hear all the time, \"I'm not sure what I want to do next.\"  And in my head I think, \"Well, what *don't* you want to do?\"  Most people know *exactly* what they won't put up with: a shitty boss, working seven days a week, too much traveling, working for unappreciative clients, etc. Now that you know what you *don't* want, all you have to do is reverse that to find out what you *do* want. It's a surprisingly simple technique.\n\nActionable Nugget\n-----------------\n\nFor today's actionable nugget, I want you to ask yourself this question:\n\n> *How can I get smarter?*\n\nThen, invert it!  What actions would guarantee you DON'T get smarter?  You'll probably come up with a ton of these right away. Then, all you need to do is *stop doing those things.*\n\nLet me know what you come up with.\n\n[This is also a podcast episode if you're interested in listening](http://fuckingread.com/podcasts/inversion/).",

Along with a bill from the post office for the cost of returning it?\n\n\nI am fine with advertisements coming to me from companies that I patronize, or if I've specifically invited ads.  \n\n\nI'm sick of the unsolicited stuff.  Especially the devious stuff that tries to look like something it's not.  \"Your auto warranty is expiring\" or \"You're required to comply with...\" type of stuff.\n\n\nSometimes I put a \"return to sender\" sticker on it, after obliterating my own address information.  I don't know if the postal service actually delivers it back to them, but I hope so.  It goes into one of their blue boxes, so I'd guess they have to do *something* with it.",

            "selftext": "Ok, I have an idea for a product that is a bit ridiculous, but would be simple to execute.\n\nMost men have been curious at one point what the size of their penis is. Usually this entails finding a ruler (which most people don't have laying around), and then pushing that sharp, uncomfortable ruler up against their pubic bone to measure their length - 'bone pressed' length as it is called because you're pressing up against your pubic bone to get the accurate scientific measurement.\n\nWell, most people - or at least most younger people without children - don't own a ruler, and don't' really even have any other reason to own a ruler but for this one purpose. I speak from experience here, lol.\n\nMost people own a tape measure, but in order to measure your 'bone pressed length', you need a rigid measuring device to be able to press down for an accurate measurement. Also a tape measure is sharp and bit dangerous to use around your manhood.\n\nThen, once a measurement is ascertained, a guy may spend half an hour on the internet researching what is normal, what percentile he's in, etc.\n\nMy product idea would fill this little niche. I believe this is a little niche because what guy has not wondered how big they are before?\n\nThe product would be a clear, plastic, cylindrical tube that is one foot in length and approximately 7\" in circumference. Think like an Aeropress coffee maker, but just longer. On the tube would be markings for inches and centimeters, as well as the associated percentiles with each length. The base would be flared (like the Aeropress), so that the user could easily press the cylindrical ruler down on their pubic bone without discomfort.\n\nWith this product, a man could easily read his length, determine what percentile he is in for his country/the world/etc - perhaps multiple percentiles will be listed based on classifiers like geolocation.\n\nThis is certainly a novelty product, but one that could be sold for decent markup, and is super easy to deal with. I have done some mild research, and haven't seen a similar product\n\nAnyways, let me know your thoughts, and if I'm just a stupid idiot :)",

You shout 'Emergency.  Car pull over.'  The car uses cameras and sensors to pull over and then flips on hazard lights.\n\nAnd anytime the system is used it automatically contacts 911 with your location.  \n\nAnd if you went driving drunk, and the system safely pulled you over, I think a massively reduced criminal penalty should be allowed.  Like, you still are in big trouble and pay a big fine, but maybe your life isn't ruined the way a DUI/DWI will.  ",

This is a multi-step process (have to go to your email, wait until the email comes, click on it, click on the link, click confirm, click sign in...) \n\nWhat if instead you installed, let's say, a Chrome extension that you would set up with your email only once (let's say it only works with Gmail.) What you would do is verify that you own your Gmail address with your Chrome extension, and then the website could verify your identity via proxy by interfacing with the Chrome extension. This way, all you would have to do is click on the extension and click \"Verify email\" and it would do it all for you.\n\n\nTechnical details\n\nI'm not a security person, so feel free to let me know if this is insecure. You would install the extension, and type in your Gmail address. The extension would then send you an email with a link that you would have to click on. When you do, the extension knows that you own that email address. So, when a website asks the extension if it is your email address, the extension goes to Google's servers to create a verification token, and sends that to the website. The website sends the verification token and your gmail address to Google, and then Google will respond with yes, this person owns this email or no, this person does not own this email. \n\n",

I know the cons of an addict possibly getting one, but a prerequisite would be having to be clean for a full year and having to have regularly donated for the same amount of time, which you can't do with dirty blood. Anyway, it'd be like the valve cancer patients get, except in your inner elbow instead of your chest and would be really small so it wouldn't really affect your day to day. And if, for any unexplainable reason, you don't donate for a period longer then a month, it would be reclaimed or you would be charged a fee that would be kinda unfair if you didn't come in to get it removed.\n\nDoes this seem viable?

This would provide a clear way for people to see that these things are *actually happening now*, and allow people to see what will happen in the future in a trustworthy manner (based on all the previous predictions on the site coming true or whatever).",

The outside is a cloth or any material that could soak up the grease or atleast remove some of it while the inside is plastic so the grease doesn't soak through to the controller, once you're done or its wayyy too dirty, you just unzip and wash. \n\nOpinions or anyone know where I could pitch this idea?",

At any given time, one of these filters would be intercepting the blood stream, ideally filtering out unwanted substances like Cholesterol. As resistance from contaminant buildup increases, the wheel spins and a new filter moved into place. \n\nIf possible, the filters would be able to clean themselves - this would require removal of the stored contaminant at some point, but I think this could potentially be a proactive treatment for high Cholesterol.",

By using a motorised platform and a bunch of included digital sensors you're now able to control a lot of adjustments automatically or at least remotely, and you can leave the plants longer without manual care.\n\nThe value is in the plant maintenance. it's quite a pain in the ass for people with little time and maybe not super-organised enough to tend to some plants. the difference i guess from just a pot on a stand with one of those automated watering systems is that it can move towards light and is a more self-contained solution without need for tubes beyond the pot. and you know.. it has an app :D\n\nHow can we do that with a plant? Well give it some tech.. \n\n- take a standard plant pot size. \n- load it with useful digital sensors like pH meter, hydrometer, maybe even a lux meter to have all that specific data for the pot\n- get a little electric wheeled platform enough to carry up to say.. 20-30kg pot-plant\n- use that to allow the plant to move around the house like a robot vac. but to get itself into a better position for light. You might have a nice sunny window - get them to be able to move themselves into the best light spots while you're out of the house automatically\n- load it with extra water container enough to provide for the plant for say a week or more and maybe optional nutrients/fertilizer (some of which could be only fed when triggered. say you got a particular pH reading so then it triggers a threshold to control add some chemical)\n- the plants actual health (moisture level, sunlight per day, pH etc) will be monitored and reflected on an app/webpage (use a mini pc on-board or a server just getting the raw stats regularly)\n\n- the game will be around making sure it's healthy. maybe you forgot to lift your window blinds and the plants get enough sunlight so you get a lower score there and some reminders to do something about the light.\n- you'll need to refill the on-board water reservoir (maybe they could have a system to get water regularly with some automated watering system)\n- power: some sort of battery, solar panels (enough as is practical cost and space-wise.. perhaps opening like a flower like those large scale ones)\n\n**extended ideas**\n\nso now you have this little plant-carrying robot platform around your house. what other features could we imagine adding:\n\n- get it to carry an amazon echo/google home type of far-field microphone integrated device.. \n- some sort of light-weight fan maybe? given these plants are going to add a nice smell to the air it could help to give it a little push\n- getting a little ahead but... if you could get all that working nicely and then merge with some fairly basic-level AI you could start having little conversations... \"i think i need more water\"\n- allow it to draw water from water feature?\n\n**problems**\n\n- physical extent of foliage might not be known by the program. the plant might have grown long branches or stems sticking out of the pot and will bump them into things without having provision for dealing with it.",

The nurses would come in if it was drastically low (albeit slow to respond) but up until that point he would still need assistance, reassurance, or just company when it was difficult to breath. This was fine while we were in the room watching his vitals on the screen, but when we needed to go to the bathroom or run out for lunch we would have no idea. If his vitals crashed while we were out of sight of him there was no way we could know.\n\nI think these vital monitors should be web enabled. Each machine has a unique ID and a password/pin is reset for each patient. Then visitors can be given the pin and log in via a web portal to monitor the patients vitals on a phone or computer.",

I know services such as bandcamp, soundcloud, and reverbnation already do this but I find that the lack of a democratic popularity-based system makes it difficult to sort through the muck and ultimately turns off the casual listener.\n\nFor example, I want someone to be able to move to say, Austin, and go into the service and have the hottest local bands available at their fingertips as well as being able to browse by genre, again by popularity but also through curated playlists, pairing up similar bands.\n\nIdeally I wanted Apple Music/Spotify/Tidal to add a feature of this sort, but I have tried to contact them and they seem to busy to listen to any ideas, so I am trying to go it on my own. \n\nHere is a link for a prototyped home-page, based off of spotify: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bz6qGtBQBZZEYmpYMDJvRGo0Tjg/view?usp=sharing \n\nIdeas for names for the service and other contributing ideas are gratefully accepted!",

I want to learn React Native (a framework for developing apps on both iOS and Android). \n\nEvery time I start learning a new framework/tool I am trying to challenge myself with a small project. \n\nSo if you have an idea laying around, just drop it to me and I'll try to make it happen :) \n\nSome side thoughts: \n\n* Once finished I could open source it\n* I could live stream the development of it\n* If we get more than 20 submissions I will take on the idea that has most upvotes (hope this will not backfire)\n\nCheers!",

They suffer the horrible ordeal due to the time they need to patrol an area and using sub-standard boots that are hard and uncomfortable. \n\n\nThe idea is to create a jelly like sock that acts as 2nd skin and it can have tiny pores so it's breathable. The materials can be 2 mm thick  that is durable and include anti-microbial capability. \n\n\nIf you by chance get rich by this don't forget me ok? :)",

            "selftext": "In this world, magic is slow and intensive, often using multiple components. It requires intense focus, and spells and rituals can take hours to prepare. Nevertheless, it can be very powerful, and serves as the bedrock of this nation. Magic is combined with technology to form a kind of magi tech which is available to everyone. However, only women can access magic directly to create it. This culture strongly discourages women from military positions, believing them to be too valuable to society in general.\n\nIronically, the exception to this rule is the state church itself. The church is made up of priestesses that are the most powerful magic users in the nation. It's military sect contains warrior nuns, and are sometimes used on the frontlines in warfare. They specialize in a form of attack and defense magic that is much faster and stronger than traditional forms of magic. These spells take the form of incantations, which involve hand signals as well as words that must be spoken. \n\nThis form of magic revolves around four schools:\n\n1. Biomancy: the practice of powering up soldiers to increase their effectiveness. Increasing strength or speed, regenerating lost limbs, healing, hardening skin and increasing endurance\n2. Pyromancy: Shooting fireballs, making firestorm to wipe out armies, raining down fire from the sky.\n3. Telekinesis: moving objects with the mind. Creating shields and barriers to block projectiles, using gravity offensively to crush enemie's\n4. Divination: reading possible futures to create strategies, determining movements of enemies and possible outcomes of events\n\nA few more points about this magic:\n\n\u2022 performing a spell normally take 3-5 minutes, with the stronger ones taking up to an hour.\n\n\u2022this faster form of magic is dangerous and hard to control. It requires more focus than regular, slower spells. Performing it unsuccessfully can severely hurt or kill the user.\n\n\u2022this magic is physically and mentally intense, and drains the user over a period of time.\n\nBased on these stipulations, what would be the best way to use these warrior nuns strategically in a combat situstion. What tactics should they employ to maximize their effectiveness?",

            "selftext": "We have had elected leaders since the beginning because that is the easiest way to go about governing ourselves. Having everyone show up in a public square becomes too chaotic. But that was then -- we didn't have any other choice. Now we have technology that can change up what democracy looks like. The following is a whole bunch of ideas stitched up together. I keep adding to it, but there's probably too much text now, so I'll leave it be.\n\nWhat if everyone voted at the same time (need to declare a national holiday), only needing internet access to achieve this? Our phones are secure enough to display bank data, so why shouldn't this be viable?\n\nNow everyone needs access, so free phones are given to the public, but only to those that need it. Phones have the durability to withstand almost anything now and everyone should have access to wifi anyway. Everyone deserves access.\n\nThis phone would of course be optimized for durability, nothing too flashy. Think of the government programs that exist (and the ones that are quickly being ended) -- now compare their costs to this one. A phone like this should cost less than $500 per person after getting through the startup costs.\n\nSo everyone has a phone for internet access, available everywhere. Phones could even serve as our IDs -- they already serve as plane tickets don't they? But that's a whole other topic.\n\nAnyway, back to the voting. Once a year, we vote on all kinds of topics. People are required to participate in this process and the counting of votes is live. Here's the thing though -- there are too many things to vote on, right? Who votes on what will be chosen randomly to distribute the responsibility.\n\nMore on voting: each piece of legislation is voted on during regular time intervals, live. The choices include more than just \"yes\" or \"no\" though. Also included is \"indifferent\" and \"I don't understand.\" The first option is shown to inflate the percentage relating to voter participation. The second option is self explanatory. All legislation should be easily understood. If it doesn't make sense, it needs to be broken down to simpler explanations. And guess what -- there is a comment section, like reddit, where people can ask questions, comment, etc. Because this is an official app, lawyers are given special flairs to demonstrate authority when explaining / answering questions.\n\nNow back to the phones. People can have free phones if they don't already have them. Predownloaded apps could include nearly everything. There could be apps for the unemployed, for example. Etc, etc, etc. Notifications tell you about emergencies (similar to the amber alert) or about things you need (e.g. jobs).\n\nThis idea has so much potential. It's also pretty crazy. The impact of our votes would never feel more real. Our involvement with government policy would be something we'd want to do. Sure, things will be passed that shouldn't have been passed because they were moved too quickly, but that always happens and can be quickly reversed through this process.\n\nHelp me refine the idea. I know there are a lot of issues to deal with -- but that's just life when dealing with other people. I honestly believe this is a cause worth supporting.",

            "selftext": "I am currently volunteering for a program that helps high school dropouts attain their GED's. One of the common problems with the students is that they lose interest and do not finish because they think it seems pointless. Many of these students are working manual labor jobs with high school graduates so they see the future as being more of the same even with a GED, and part of me has to agree with them. \n     \nSo, for the idea. I want to start a GED program that partners with local business. The local businesses would employ students who attain a high score on their GED in a position that they have consistent turnover at whilst paying for the student to attain their associate's degree, bachelor's degree, or trade certification. Lastly, the employer will agree to interview the student for a higher position upon graduation.  \n    \nThis fills a high turnover position long term for the employer and gives them an employee who has shown them a great work ethic. After the student graduates it gives them an employee that is now specialized, educated, and loyal to the company that helped them attain their degree. \n\nAs for the students, it helps them attain their GED with the opportunity for a better future. \n\nOther aspects could include partnering with the local schools to lessen the tuition for these students and involving local newspapers to write an article about the student's graduation and give publicity to the company that took part in the program. \n\nLastly, I know the name Underdog Academy is a little lame and slightly insulting but I am trying to think of something that will help get the students into it. I want to make shirts and possibly have a diploma ceremony when they attain their GED. Again, I know that part sounds a little lame but many of these students come to our center are VERY down on their luck so anything to get behind and be a part of could be big for them. \n\nThe point of this post is to gauge if the Reddit community thinks this could work. Do you think companies will bite on this? Is it too much to expect a company to pay for their employee's education? Which part will entice employers more, PR or the opportunity for a loyal and hard working employee? Any and all thoughts are welcomed so please let me know what you guys and gals think. \n\n\n",

They are also not very massive (though, orders of magnitude more massive than singular particles; maybe where this idea breaks down), so maybe it would be possible to accelerate a colony almost to the speed of light, making time for the colony move slower relative to our time? There's a reason they're called PARTICLE accelerators, I suppose, and the amount of time needed to keep the bacteria moving at that speed would cost a lot of energy I believe. \n\nJust a thought I had, maybe one day we could use this as the first life forms time traveling.

It could poke out the side of the phone next to the lock button and winding it up/down would scroll the phone as well as produce a charge.\n\nThe I thought you could use a setup like a mouse trackball to scroll and also create a charge. Googled that and there is a patent for a mouse that utilizes it:\nhttps://www.google.com/patents/US6903725\n\nWhat I'm thinking is it could plug into the USB port and stick out right below it. Then you scroll it to scroll the phone. You can change the resistance for increased scroll speed as well as charging (I think).",

It'd be similar to ShowerThoughts or TIFU. Maybe TIFU would have a microphone for each person telling their story and a mini stage.\n\nGaming would be just a bunch of gamers and gaming related things. Maybe some game merch being sold and previews to upcoming releases.\n\nScience or ExplainLikeImFive would be run by qualified scientists who want to answer your questions about science related things. There'd be a bunch of featured science topics at the booth and maybe a robot. \n\nAww would just be a nice little booth of cute things, maybe behind the booth there's puppies and kittens borrowed from a local shelter to get them visibility to be adopted.\n\nCreepy or NoSleep would be creepy related things. There'd be a horror decked out booth in front of a room. Inside the room it's dark, there's a fake camp fire and everyone's sharing scary stories. The booth would have merch like pamphlets of different scary folklore, shrunken heads, and maybe a few plush slendermen.  \n\nMaybe even the lesser known subreddits would get a booth and have different things with them. LetsNotMeet and CreepyEncounters would have self defense classes and tales of real life horrifying experiences. \n\nMild controversial booths would be allowed but only if they behave, be respectful, and leave out any prominent weirdness.\n\nBooths that hate each other would comically battle. TwoXChromosomes and MensRights would be two booths across from each other, and we'd arm both booths with nerf guns.

Like automatic soap dispensers, which we find in nearly every public restroom these days, why do we not have automatic water dispensers next to the toilet paper so that you can pop a few drops on your toilet paper before wiping? Seems like it would be incredibly easy to develop these and sell them since they would essentially be automatic soap dispensers with water lines attached.",

            "selftext": "All thought is regurgitation. Could be true. Lacan talks about how all language is external, never internally generated. Our thoughts are language based so all thought is actually externally generated. There is genetic propensity though.\n\nThe brain is binary. You get hit in the head - you cry, or you attack back and hit them in the head. Inside, you are still crying though, you hit back to ameliorate the pain of repressing the full hurt feelings you experience when being hit. As adult, the former person never fight back, they just cry. The latter person always fights back b/c they have no choice b/c they cannot feel the hurt. They hit the people that cry and this feels good. They can see their own feelings, long forgotten but still under the surface, reflected in that other person. The hit person enjoy being hit b/c it was a formative experience, they are defined by it and must have it repeat or they will lose their identity. The hitter must also hit others and vicariously experience their pain but this never actually resolves it - it must also repeat and it's tied to their identity as well. This is a co-dependency - of sadism/masochism.\n\nLet's not get caught up in a false equivalency here though. The hitter and the hitted are not equal for a sadist is always the bad person, the masochist is simply addicted to that bad person but they are not bad themselves. A masochist will likely be an exceptionally good person, having their badness expressed through the sadism of their partner and introject rather than project. They are two sides of the same coin, but each side is not equal, the sadism side is much heavier in its effect on society. Two masochist may binge and purge food together but two sadists will form a team and hurt others with synergistic violence that they wouldn't do alone.\n\nThere are no people that are born bad but there are people whose natural genetic propensity is to respond to abuse with sadism on others, to project that pain onto innocents. That is evil.",

            "selftext": "So this Idea came to me when i was working one day and time flew by and I had no clue where it was spent...\n\nObviously you don't want to give this to your employers but I thought it would do well to have a task tracking app that automatically tracked what you were doing... But the question was how would you go about this... I know there are tracking tools out there and they are mostly manual requiring you to start stop etc and then you have to get disciplined in using them... Me personally I start them and sometimes become so absorbed in what I am doing I forget to stop and thus the time is pointless because its way over run.\n\nSo I though what about a tracker that actively monitored the windows that were focus/open on your desktop be it windows/linux or mac. This will be what ever you activate be it email etc it would time how long you were active in that application if you are running multiple desktops it would time both but not which one is active etc... that way as your usage is recorded you can start flagging things for instance if you visit company portals you can mark those URL's as work related and if lets say you are on Facebook you can mark it as social etc and you would automatically be shown where your time was spent. Over time one could expand this enable cloud sync for a small nominal fee monthly or have a fixed once of purchase that gives you sync using a platform like Dropbox to store info etc this would allow cross platform in a way but the cloud sync would work much more seamless i guess... Developing would require a little creativity but I think I am illustrating the point or objective and then you would get creative in how to clearly capture what is currently actually being worked in or on.\n\nI know this dawned on me during work hours which is why I thought while its cool to have that view I personally wouldn't want my employer to have that so No to the employer integration etc.\n\nI clearly state in my mind this would be nice as its ridiculous how much time we spend on a PC both personal and work so it would be nice to see what we are doing for those who think it interesting and maybe instead of keeping intensive info after a month it gets consolidated into a report/analytics view and extensive information is purged.\n\nI hope I was clear but if any more clarity is needed just ask...\n\nBTW... I have other ideas that I am actually invested in so I thought I would just put this out there and hear what people thought and if anyone has time to do this great but I know I don't.",

This way you have a record of your purchases. Each receipt could have a unique code so you could bring that to customer service when you want to return something. You wouldn't lose receipts.\n\nBank cards could be tied to email addresses to automate the process. A customer goes in, buys something with debt/credit, and the POS system takes care of the rest. For cash purchases you could either keep your code on your smartphone or you could just print a receipt anyways.\n\nTo cut down on volume of emails sent, they could be sent in bulk, or a customer could email the server with a request to get all receipts in the buffer. I have no idea if this would cut on cost for buying receipt paper. Mainly I hate getting so many receipts that I never even look at and just throw out... it seems like a waste.",

            "selftext": "On twitch.tv people speedrun games. Jogging is also sort of like that... you run a route and try to cut down your time. So, you could send your GPS location through your smartphone SMS service every 15 seconds or whatever, and receive it on a desktop computer, which then updates your location on a map just like a video game minimap. Perhaps even heavily compressed audio could be sent via SMS... as a quick estimate/test, 1000 bytes can get about a second of intelligible audio. So that is definitely possible as a way to interact with twitch viewers. When jogging, you can reliably press at least 5 different buttons on a smartphone screen with little difficulty (for UI design purposes). So this makes the whole thing entirely possible. The smartphone app could also have the basic C25K functionality.\n\nSo basically, you are jogging, you have your smartphone on your armband, you can read messages sent from twitch chat on your SMS service, and you can send audio and GPS coordinates from your SMS service to a desktop which handles the twitch stream. Let's get gamers off the couch and into the mysterious outside real world.",

            "selftext": "I came up with a neat idea for a Monopoly game. Make one that is based off of internet and technology. For example, all of the streets would be websites like \"google.com\" \"reddit.com\" and more with .com, .org, .edu, and other suffixes being the colour categories (or have colour based on the type of website: social media, search engine, etc.) The hotels and houses (I think those are the only two?) could be made into advertisements, since the properties are put onto streets in the original game and the owner collects money when someone lands on it. Advertisements make money when someone goes to that website, completing the analogy. The railroads could be ISPs like Comcast, Time Warner Cable and more.  The \"chance cards,\" as I believe they are called could be things like real word occurrences such as, \"Cease and Desist! Lose a hostname, $X and go to jail,\" or stuff more targeted to the legal actions in Congress and such. What I think would be the coolest part is the different player pieces. You could have a Snoo, mouse pointer,  Twitter's bird, and other \"icons\" of the internet. \n\nI had this idea yesterday while on the phone with a client, so I may have missed some game concepts, but I think this would be a cool idea for a licensed Monopoly game.\n\nEdit: It seems that this idea has already been taken!",

            "selftext": "In the 1970s there was a school in England named Summerhill where students did no formal studying; they just did their own thing like reading, playing, talking, etc and for graduation they're required to write and defend an essay (in front of a panel of adults) on how they're going to be a productive person when they leave Summerhill.\n\nThat's a bit too extreme for me and many others, but I propose something similar to the Summerhill model but with a new requirement: a school where students don't engage in formal academic study, but instead prepare for and enter competitions all year long in order to graduate and earn a qualification.\n\nCompetitions can include the usual school fare like forensics, cheerleading, sports, writing, math Olympiad etc. and also include the ones more open to the general public like film festivals, singing competitions, novel writing, amateur sports, etc. If we want to stretch the scope of \"competition\" we can even include art exhibitions, presenting papers at a conference, stage theater, marathon runs, building a computer etc.\n\nEach student should commit to preparing for and entering a specific number of competitions, chosen from a list compiled by the school admin from information submitted by organizations, businesses, city council, federal govt, etc. They would not be required to win (although that would be a bonus and a huge boost) but they must document every single step of the way, pre-, while- and post-competition. Obviously competitions will overlap in time, and some takes longer to prepare than others, so students would have to submit their personal training/preparation schedule to be approved by the school before they're allowed to start anything.\n\nThe teachers would not be teaching in the traditional sense but instead become more like an enabler: finding a music studio, sourcing scientific equipment, hooking up with experts, drive students around, help them plan their prep. But the bulk of preparation should be done by the students themselves.\n\nIn order to graduate, students would be required to present the documentation of the competitions they've entered, plus another presentation on the hard skills (academic or technical know-how) and soft skills they have learned after entering these competitions.",

            "selftext": "*PLEASE READ THIS* Hi guys! This is an application I've already built. It allows the user to make an editable list (consisting of item name and quantity), in which he/she can select items, set a default email, and send the list to the default email address.\n\nWhile using this app, users will be able to build and build their list (for example: grocery), meanwhile selecting the items they want to buy. At the end of the week, when they are ready to do some grocery, all they have to do is click one button and their *selected* list will be sent to their store's email address. And the moment they reach the store, the shopkeeper (if he's nice enough) will have the items ready for the user to buy, saving time and smoothening this experience.\n\nI believe this won't be too useful in the US, but wanted to know if it would be useful in other countries, where there are comparatively more local stores (stores near ones house which are not chains).\n\nI believe this feature would be useful in developing and fast paced countries where it would be convenient for one to have items ready to buy the moment they reach the store.\n\nAny advice, thought, pros, cons, additions, would be very appreciated!\n\nThanks you!",

The problem with a lot of shows is they're boring, but still have just enough interesting parts to perk you up. An example is Frasier. Pretty much a drag, but it has its moments. So the programming would be like Frasier, less the slap-stick bits. \n\nAdverts would need to conform to a set of guidelines. No flashing or sudden noises. Just calm and boring. This would benefit advertisers by making it easier to reach viewers at the one time they're not being distracted -- by other activities like reading or having a conversation with the TV in the background. The advertiser OWNS the audience.\n\nThe key to making, and then retaining the market, would be training people to associate the Insomnia Channel with normal bedtime ritual. When they skip the TV altogether, they then have trouble falling asleep. This would reinforce the association. Shift workers could train themselves whilst working normal hours -- then when bedtime changes in the future, the Insomnia Channel is there 24 hours per day.\n",

Muck.\n\nMuck has been at our docks for a long time so it's nothing new but it seems that muck has the ability to build up and is impeding on our space and the lives of fish and habitat beneath us.\n\nMuck is a collection of everything that has ever come into contact with the lake, over time.  It does build up and warmer weather and water lead to additional algae growth which can simply add to more muck.\n\nSome say dredging is the answer but the EPA has done the science and the answer is a clear no for most cases.\n\nThis weekend in Bailey's Harbor I saw a lot of nastiness in the water near the marina and it was not looking good.  It made me think though, don't dock owners have a vested interest in keeping the water around their dock clean?  Doesn't \"muck\" impact the materials used to make boats?\n\nAnd, do you realize that our boats are slowly leaking oil into the waters?  It sounds crazy but it's true.  You gotta really keep an eye on your two stroke engines.\n\nSo, the question is this --- can aeration be the simple answer to all of this?  Of course, it's never simple with water systems but could oxygenation of the water be a simple balancing factor that could be applied pretty much everywhere?  \n\nI know this isn't an environmental sub and I'm not expecting a science answer in any depth, moreso I want to pitch the idea as a concept.  \n\nA simple system -- solar, net, digester -- self contained system.",

So i was thinking of a kind of Hybrid Plane like hybrid cars. Ofc not the \"special game breaking\" idea and i googled a bit. Some companys already started on this idea. My Lightbulb in this case is to kinda encourage (kinda force) the Airplane industry to work together on this project. I can imagine that this is kinda hard because mostly all want everything 4 themself and they have to replace all planes whats kinda expensiv because if they get a breakthrough they have to replace their planes and a fresh breakthrough is gonna followed by many improvments so they have to upgrading their planes even more. So they need a good reason. Mby some kind of Air lizenses if the Air Transportation get cheaper.\nTheir research should made puplic and a Council should messure the contribution of the Single Companys. A Kind of joining ultimatum should be made. Giving Companys that join to late shoul get some benefit penalitys. That can cause that the Companys share their research results fast so it counts towards them.\n\ntl;dr Let Company work together on Hybrid Planes\n\nps.: Englisch isn my mother tongue sry for mistakes\n\nEdit: just saw this [link](https://www.flightradar24.com/49.71,11.86/6) of /u/sp4cerat  \n",

This idea is based on my observation that I use my cellphone less while riding on transportation because it induces dizziness/nausea. Perhaps there could be an app like the Blue Light App, which is a filter that lets you use your phone without blue light. Except this app would be a filter inducing mild dizziness, a small annoyance so that you don't want to use your phone too long. It won't be so bad that you can't use your phone, just so that you won't want to use it too long. Eventually you will train yourself, Pavlovian style, not to stay glued to your phone. I'm not sure what kind of filter would do this, maybe it would need to flicker or wobble the screen a bit?",

It would have to be well organized and high quality. I'm not just talking about a bottle of Jack people are swigging from between rounds. I'm talking professionally selected and made shooters or shots of liquor. Like maybe they have a whisky tasting night or a tropical shooters night or something. The effects of alcohol are supposed to be a part of the tournament, so anyone who doesn't drink can't join the next round. Maybe allow one non drinker team so everyone conceivably has a DD. The alcohol content and pace of the shots should be enough that people are well buzzed at the end of tournament, but not wasted.\n\nDrinking activities work best for things where being uninhibited is helpful but a lot of people feel a little inhibited doing it in front others, like dancing and artistic pursuits. Paintball is similar in that the paintballs hurt so most newbies will be overly cautious and often afraid to leave cover and advance. Throw in a little booze, though, and people would probably have a better time and make the sort of bold moves that make the battles much more fun and interesting. They probably wouldn't mind getting hit as much either. By the end people would be coming out guns blazing like the Terminator.",

            "selftext": " Okay, an alternative horoscope where the constellations of our ancestors  - only those that are related to the Messiah (Jesus) /and his davidic descendant Rabbi relatives/ through the non-Jewish davidic line /Habsburgs, Hohenzollerns, Bourbons etc./ are felt by us through inherited stress hormones /yes they do exist/ that are triggered by melodies around us. Which melodies are repeated regularly listened by kings?  Well, opera melodies. But what about the messiah-waiting rabbis?  They have a weekly changing set of Bible reading melodies which can be found in operas.\n\nSo how do we arrive to the horoscopes. We have a list of historical figures with their stresses (assassinations,wars, etc.) and their dates. Each week the majority melody is searched in operas - and the respective opera viewer kings are  found (with the contemporary messianic rabbi). And we just are interested - together with the rabbi - in the horoscope sign of the king. And we do look up the signs of three of their ancestors - according to the Kabbalist method where the different emotional spheres (or horoscope signs) are always creating a family through different centuries. The \"family\" is set up from the 1500s years (and the decades of 20s and 70s) as an innovative and bipolar Brother (or \"Son\")  level , also called \"Recovery\" (Tiferet) . It corresponds to a \"problem\" or \"demand\" or \"lack\": the schizoid compulsive or addictive Sister (or Virgo) called Ownership (or Malkuth). It is in the  1800-1900s  years and in the decades of 50/60s and Zeros/Tens. And in between there are two other levels, the paternalistic Father (depressive and borderline goal-setting level) in the 1600s and in the decades 30s and 80s. Then comes  the materialistic nurturing and narcissistic Mother in the 1700s and in the 40s and 90s. \n\nSo next week according to the melody chart we will be echoing (from the hormonal inheritance list) 1772 - when Poland was partitioned (by Russia and Austria, Maria Theresa). It is a Brother decade of sharing and innovation in the 50 years cycles.. If we look up the year it is when King Gustav III of Sweden has managed to get the throne by a coup. He was a cousin of Tzarina Catherine the Great /Russia/ and nephew of Frederic the Great. /Prussia/./Born 24 January, Sign: Aquarius. The Brother decade has the Solutions (in Kabbalah) for the demands and lacks of the Sister Decade which is in the 1800-1900s - here it belongs to 1979, Lord Mountbatten's assassination. He was born on 28 June: in the Sign of Cancer.\nBetween these two levels we have the Mother century and decade (with Narcissistic character issues) in the 1700s it is 1799: Napoleon's putch of Brumaire 18. /Born: Aug 15 1867. Sign: Leo. This is the field or sphere of tools from problem to solution. And the Father shphere (the Goal-setting) is in the 1600s. Like Queen Christina of Sweden born in 1626. dc 18. Sagittarius. These Kings are the Pharaonic rulers causing wars and stress - and viewed with attention by the Messiah-awaiting rabbis of their respective times. They are using the Horoscope to find out what character defects they must influence with their healing melodies while meditating and reading the Torah (it is the week of Pinhas the zealot.)\nSagittarius and Leo /Mother and Father/: A love of the good life and lots of laughter will be experienced together.\nAquarius and Cancer /Brother and Sister/: Cancerians look for security and warmth from an Aquarius but their secretive nature will make them uncomfortable.\n\nSo we will have fun - if we are able to overcome our paranoia and isolation.\n\n(Who may use this kind of \"histro-scope\"?  I think anyone who accepts the premise - that not directly from the stars but indirectly through imagined ancestral leaders' constellations /triggered by weekly melodies of Bible reading/  we may use the weekly changing horoscopes of some kingly ancestors (source: Hellinger) as psychological archetypes (source: C.G. Jung).\n\n",

And so many people spend alot of money on thinkpads or thinkpad knockoffs.\n\nRecently I came across this mouse:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/QGEYO\n\nWhich is like a joystick mouse that you use to play video games with.\n\nI think that this design could be modified so that a smaller model of it rests on the left side of your index finger and you use your thumb to move the mouse, so that way you can use your mouse without moving your hands away from the keyboard on any keyboard.\n\nThis would be really useful for programmers and I wish that I could go buy one somewhere but it does not exist.\n\nThere are ring mice out there but they use teeny touchpads which are hard to use. It needs to either be a nub mouse, a joystick, or a ball mouse in a ring.",

It'll always be the same ups and downs, the same loops and corkscrews, just maybe a different group of people or different time of day. But what if that weren't the case? What if there were a rollercoaster that was able to take multiple possible routes, and you had no idea which it would take beforehand? Something like a 15% chance for a mild route, a 35% chance for a moderate route, a 25% chance for an intense route, and only a 5% chance for the ultra-extreme route. Passengers would have to fit all the criteria for being able to go on the ultra-extreme route, regardless of what route the train actually ends up taking. The only way to know which way you're going is for the ride to start.",

My dad tried to replace his last time with metal ones, but when we tried to replace it, the acid from urine had corroded it to where we had to use a hacksaw to cut it at the top.  I'm thinking we need the nuts and bolts made of some sort of advanced polymer that would not break, and be resistant to the acid in urine.  Ideally I would like to have them be easily screwed on and off for at least 20-30 years. Does anybody make anything like that?",

Each piece of the sculpture would represent a single principle that every human can agree on and that will remain true forever. Since objects in polar orbit (i.e. traversing the north and south poles) will at some point cross over every point on the planet then the sculpture will be visible everywhere.  \n\nThe sculpture would be a constant reminder of a set of enduring principles to which every human can subscribe regardless of race, creed or political hue.  \n\nThe big question is: which principles should be represented by the sculptures?  \n\nPlease discuss any and all aspects of this idea below! How big would a sculpture have to be to be seen from Earth? How should proposals for sculptures be gathered and selected? How much would it cost? How could we pay for it? Would such a mega art project have the desired effect? \n\nhttp://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/2016/06/05/original-stonehenge-was-dismantled-in-wales-and-moved-to-wiltshi/",

When I was a single guy I believe the only time i ever ironed a shirt was when I was a groomsmen in a wedding. Every other day I had wrinkly or questionably fresh clothes I just through my shirt or shorts in the dryer with a dryer sheet.

This idea is intended to de-escalate the situation from a lethal altercation to a potentially, and perhaps probably, non-lethal one. \n\nIn an opposing scenario, where an officer armed only with a gun engages with a knife wielder, the said officer's only option for defense is the only weapon they are equipped with, a gun. In other words they are forced to use a potentially lethal weapon.\n\nOfficers trained in hand to hand combat, or who are armed with other non-lethal weapons, would however have another option for active engagement. Providing the said officer is equipped with appropriate protection, a non-lethal engagement should be easily won by the trained officer, with little risk of injury to either party (or at least have a lower risk of mortality compared to a altercation containing an officer armed only with lethal forcer).\n\nI acknowledge that there are certain weaknesses to this idea, such as the cost of training, and perhaps the limited times such specific training would be used. I still think it's a good idea however, as it is a hard thing to weigh the cost of training to the cost of a life. Personally I think the life is more important.\n\nAnyway I'm pretty drunk right now, my thanks to anyone who actually read this fucking mess.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

It would work great for nuts, dried fruit, you could even put a powdered drink mix-in in there and use it in your waterbottle whenever you need. \n\nWater AND a snack in one hand!",

To our surprise, the only thing that existed was the generic newspaper type ones, which don't give you a good idea of who that person was.\n\nWith that in mind, we decided that we should build it. Which is where we can up with the idea for LiveOn.\n\nLiveOn is a mosaic of 'Forever Tiles' that will allow a family, or a loved one, to properly remember a family member or friend's life without the barriers of traditional mediums. A tile will the equivalent of cliffnotes on that person's life, along with what they loved. \n\nThe idea is to make it beautiful and content focused, unlike the newspaper obituaries of the past.\n\nIf you like this idea PLEASE PLEASE support our [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1469712273/allow-a-loved-one-to-liveon-forever-with-a-forever) \n\nThanks guys!",

Or someone can ask for a service from you based on your skills and specialties. The website is free to use. The rates of services are up to the people to decide. There could be a predictive system that suggests other users who can fulfill your request. The focus is local but not limited, depending on the request. \n\nSome ideas of services people can request/offer:\n\nDelivery\nBorrowing/loaning stuff\nBeauty (hairstyling, makeup, nails)\nYardwork \nMaintenance\nCooking\nCleaning\nChores \nTeaching/Tutoring\nFitness training\nPhotography \nMusic/performance gigs \nArt/crafts requests \n\nMany people have marketable skills that they could utilize, but maybe they don't relate to their primary careers. They could be hobbies they love or skills they've learned that others haven't. This website will help them earn side money without giving up their current career, or going through a tedious job application process. They become their own boss. It also helps people with low incomes so they can make money through everyday tasks and their abilities. \n\nRequesters can ask for anything under the sun, within legal guidelines. They can borrow an item, get help with personal tasks, and relinquish chores. Have someone else wash your car for a few bucks. Get a haircut. Have a fitness enthusiast come with you to the gym and give you tips. There are all sorts of things people need assistance with and many are willing to help, but these groups can't find each other. This website brings those groups together so they can help one another. It lets you skip any hassle so you can connect directly with the people you need. \n\nI've found a few similar websites. Freelancer and Upwork have an offer-request system, but it's mostly for companies and specifically freelancers, and it's not local. Karma Tribe is similar, but the website bans the use of money. Favor is a multi-product delivery service, but it's only available in select cities. You could post in a subreddit, but there are too many to choose from and this isn't what Reddit specializes in -- it's not as effective. Long story short, there isn't a website quite like this. \n\nIt's like a fusion between Craigslist and LinkedIn, but organized, friendly, and casual. It also incorporates elements of Airbnb and Facebook. It's a symbiotic system that values trust, honesty, connection, and most of all, people. \n\nI want to know what you think. What would work, what wouldn't, and how could it be improved? What needs to be considered? Would you use this website? I need some devil's advocates in here. Leave some comments with your thoughts.

            "selftext": "Introduction\nSources of information tend to gravitate to a certain bias over time. Whether from a newspaper or user submitted content the scope of viewpoints narrow as the editor or the majority forms a user-base of like-minded individuals who settle on news which is relevant only to themselves and close neighbours or opinions they are comfortable with. Unless an explicit effort is made people isolate themselves in echo chambers confined to comfortable areas of national news and familiar views. In isolation, each news source inevitably represents a small section of the political and geographical spectrum. However, viewed as a whole and not purposefully filtered to provide you with what you want to hear it is possible to view the full range of information and avoid cutting yourself off from what may really inform your views.\n\n\nThe Aim(s)\n\u2022\tTo form a site where news is listed (from an assortment of news sources) based on importance, not necessarily by proximity or relevance to self, in order to encourage an international outlook and widen the perspective of readers.\n\u2022\tTo centralise well-written pieces conveying a variety of opinions on a wealth of subjects from think thanks and other reputable organisations \u2013 hopefully creating an intellectually focused community.\n\nExecution (Non-Technical)\nNon-user generated content such as\n\n\u2022\tNews selected from a variety of sources (i.e. national newspapers)\nand\n\u2022\tArticles selected from reputable magazines and think tanks\n\nWhich is sorted and ranked by a system focused on the importance of a piece of news (in an objective fashion) as opposed to the relevance to a user of a specific location or set of beliefs.\nAllotting similar news stories of different sources into each post.\n\nEach article has the opportunity for user discussion and comments below governed by a system similar to reddit although prevalence of comments not necessarily just ranked by popularity.\n\nThe Desired Result\n\u2022\tAvoiding a narrowing of views by selecting from a variety of news sources by an algorithm not basing decisions on personal views and geography.\n\u2022\tPromoting intellectual discovery by organising reputable non-user submitted articles into one place allowing individuals to read about topics they were not searching for nor may agree with but may be interested in.\n\u2022\tPromoting intellectual discussion by running a commenting system similar to reddit although not purely ranked on popularity of answers.\n\u2022\tCreating an intellectual community interested in the discussion and investigation of views which aren\u2019t necessarily, or may run contrary to, their own.\n\nAll of this contributes to a greater understanding of others outside our immediate surroundings and from understanding an ending to any hatred built out of misunderstanding and ignorance.\n\n\nBackstory\nA few years ago my cousin heard about a terrorist attack on the way to work from a national news source. He arrived early and so decided to look it up on his Bloomberg terminal. The number of terrorist attacks that had occurred by that early point in the morning had numbered in the hundreds. He was floored. Never before had had he realised that the information he received was so pre-selected and narrowed through a lens of national interest and national involvement. The Bloomberg terminal had access to information out of his scope that he never would have seen.\n\nEarlier this year when preparing for a selection event I attempted to further immerse myself in current affairs and ran up against the same problem. When actively trying to read about the goings-on in other countries I struggled to find information (search engines are only useful if you have something to search for) and, lacking a Bloomberg terminal, resorted to the world news page of reddit to source non-UK based stories. A source which has it\u2019s own issues.\n\nOn a slightly different note. Constantly over the past year when looking to read well-written, well-researched and intelligent pieces I\u2019ve found myself lacking. I\u2019ve so far been unable to find a site where such information is centralised. Instead, looking at the websites of various think tanks.\n\nI hope you reached the same conclusion as me. That we see the world through information sorted by proximity rather than importance; championing the less valuable stories of our immediate neighbours as opposed to those of an international origin.\n\nThe solution that came to me was to create a site where news is gathered from a variety of national and reputable sources and sorted by an algorithm prioritising importance (although incredibly qualitative) as opposed to what concerns your country or the national interest.\n\nI'd be incredibly interested in both discussing and putting into practice the above idea - working with someone/a group who collectively had the technical ability to implement such a tool.",

An existing market will need to merge with video game players. - I've tried to brainstorm how playing video games itself can have market value and have concluded that it can't.  \n\n2. A decentralized system to distribute Assets. Similar to crypto currency. \n\nCompetitive video game developers will need to come up with a system where video game players can earn and distribute assets.  Let's just say video games are that asset.  The system will determine which team of video gamers will get the most market assets by; the number of multiplayer games they've won or by ratio.  Naturally the team who gets the most assets, will sell at cheaper prices and the team who has less assets will sell at higher prices.  This will engage the video game market into picking which team is best to buy from.  The competitive video gamer will then earn some of that value that the team distributed.  Good idea? \n",

I wouldn't ever want to get off the game. I have not played for awhile but I have a lot of experience for the game and 5 maxed toons. Toontown was so much fun but I feel as if it got very repetitive and it seemed to be missing a few things. I feel like I could create a Toontown and make it 3 times as fun. I wouldn't copyright. It would have a completely new name but the same concepts. I haven't thought much into detail with this yet but I think this game could be completed. There would be different gag tracks, all sorts of different powers and abilities for the cogs (and a large variety of cogs), different ways to earn Merits, Cogbucks besides just going in the factories and mints every single time lol. There would be different paths for toontasks. They wouldn't go in the same designated order every time for each toon. Fishing, doodles, and estates would all be upgraded. There would be a total of up to 15-20 stories on cog buildings. Boss battles would be different each time and have different difficulties (if you won on a high difficulty there would be more of a reward). You could do toontasks to improve toon speed, size, battle ability, etc. There's so much that could be tweaked to the game and so many new things that could be added. This is only the first day I have thought about this idea. With weeks or months of brainstorming and a set plan I think this could be a very successful hit and a lot of fun for everyone.

            "selftext": "Gift cards have been \"exposed\" many times before as being stupid idea, as a 20\u20ac gift card is basically the same thing as a 20\u20ac bill, but just limited to a certain store. So why not give 20\u20ac bill instead?\n\nBut to make gift cards really worth it, they could be worth more than their price. For example, a 25\u20ac gift card could be 20\u20ac or something. (I really don't know the prices they should be, I'm not good at that.)\n\nThe gift card would activate after a certain time period, so that people won't abuse the system by buying a gift card and using it immediately. Obviously there would be people who would buy the gift cards and come back after the time period to save their money, but at least it would have them coming back to the store. And if that would be too big of a problem, then buying a gift card could also be limited to those who spend a certain amount of money at the same time.",

Users sign up via Facebook, Twitter or LinkedIn, allowing you to check a bit of their background and helping you choose wether or not that feedback has value to you.  \nSay you think you have a good idea, all you have to do to get some external validation is deposit 50$ on the platform and post it to the community. The community will then vote and comment on your idea, and in the end, you can split those 50$ between the users that helped you the most.\nAre you willing to pay these 50$ to get your idea validated and discussed?",

This comes from a personal experience and thought on perspective. As people age, motor skills, eyesight, and other functions decrease. With that general knowledge I've notice my grandpa seem less interested in using his phone as its complicated. He wants to use it for communication obviously even as a phone but gets confused on what icon to push, how to find a name. \n\nAnd I know someone in the audience will suggest, \"Just use Siri, or Google Home\". I throw in the stroke scenario back to you. After experiencing meeting family and friends after having a stroke and hearing stories, rehabilitation shouldnt just be focused on physical movement but also our mental state. With that comes speech and ability to think clearly again. Keeping a line of communication open between people they can trust and ability to continue to use technology to their advantage as the rest of us do. \n\nThey sell big character imprinted keyboards, remotes, big print font books... Is there a GUI? I've done light research (quick google of course) and all I find are physical phones that just look \"ancient\" and big. I want this to be a solution for outfitting current phones on the market. The first problem I see is, \"well you have to have a jailbroken iPhone or rooted Android.\" So... now what?",

            "selftext": "To start ill relay my thinking before the idea came to mind. To think my idea is good you'll first have to think the following is true. America is currently on the eve of a holy war with Islam. Its population is either ignorant to this, numb to this, on one side of the upcoming war, or on the other side. Americans are being indoctrinated into Christianity knowingly or unknowingly. The church has taken on a form of its own, which is a concept that is seemingly new to our entire society due to the fact the original generation of America didn't care much for the church and it was a few years of blissful life without major religious influence. This lifestyle was then lost less than 200 years ago which is relatively new, in terms of human history. Other societies(or civilizations) around the world are already weathered and very aware of the \"plague\" of human ideals such as money, religion, and government. Americans, for the most part compared to the rest of the world, are raised in a comfortable, easy to succeed, and blissfully ignorant bubble. The contagious virus of human ideals are of course good things if you are in favor of a prosperous, thriving species. If the planet had an opinion it would not be in favor, but being human you are most likely in favor of surviving as a species. In order to stop such a massive and possibly catastrophic event like a holy war from happening we must keep the war mental instead of physical. It is urgent considering our current administration. The holy war must remain a war of the mind. (With any luck if this happens it will turn into World Holy War I). In order to keep it a war of the mind, the governments of the Middle East and the government of America must officially go to \"Holy War\" with each other. An armistice will be maintained via an extreme defensive force surrounding all middle eastern countries. It will of course be agreed upon and thoroughly thought out and debated between our country's governments before any action is taken. In order to get the people to agree to it the war may have to be started by the western countries with an ultimate show of force, giving the Muslim countries an option of either total annihilation or taking part in the mental race. This race will contain three parts. The first part of the race will be a scientific one. Who can do the following things the fastest: colonize Mars, cure cancer, develop a safe, universal AI tool, become completely renewable in their energy supply, among other things. The second part of the race will be social. It will contain a combination of things such as crime rate, economy status, educational system, unemployment rate, overall happiness, among other things. To avoid any social separation due to religion, this is done as a country and it will be decided which religion has the greatest impact on improving the social problem. The third leg of the race will be a philosophical one. Each religion gets to put out a new \"book\". So a new Bible, Quran, etc.. This book along with the scientific leg and social leg will be judged by a non-bias, diverse, universally agreed upon panel. Once the race gets going and agreed upon, all religions are allowed to enter the running. Oh! I forgot to say. The winner gets to be the final judge on a new universally agreed upon U.N. constitution developed by the religions of the world. (This doesn't have to be final, maybe they get to set a few criteria or something for the new set of Universal Laws). Anyways, any group can create their own religion and enter for a large sum of money big enough to fund the countries in their missions. This allows for major religions to get in and a few publicly funded ones like Atheism. Corporations will be allowed to get in for a large donation and they will be able to collectively add one voice to the pool of judges on the panel. The motivation to win will be that each religion's group of judges, whoever the religion picks, will get to give the yes or no to whatever new laws our planet comes up with as a whole. Enforceable laws. For some ideas think of something like legalizing drugs, gambling, or prostitution. Or maybe some new economic or environmental regulations that the entire world must abide by. Or maybe they want to establish an official universal government that controls its own separate military and police force. Think as big as possible. The decision whether to submit the new declaration for decision will be first decided as a planet. Then the winning religion will get to either give the thumbs up or thumbs down. This race will force our planet into full on progression. Shit will start happening real fast but it will slow down and the end of the race would probably end up being a lifetime from now. This is just a blip in time though. The world during the race may be good it may be bad but the end result will at least be better than this shit time period we are in now and will ultimately be better for our children.\n",

This would leave out useless petitions and focus on the things that make a real difference: contacting representatives, donating money, and *voting*.\n\nWhat I would like is a service that asks what issues you care about, and gives you the right person to contact to forward those particular issues, and sends email or text message reminders to contact representatives, with phone numbers and community-submitted suggested talking points from different perspectives and political persuasions. \n\nTake red light cameras for example. Say you read an article that reminds you how they annoy you. You could sign up, select that as an issue you care about, select the reminders you want (voting, contacting representative, etc.), and work through a list of action items on your own pace. It tells you who makes the decisions about the red light camera policies in your area, and gives you a number to call. You get a list of talking points, voted on by the userbase (for keeping, for removing, for changing, etc.), and you get to do with it what you choose. Once you're done, you check it off and go on to the next step, say voting in the relevant congressional race.\n\nThese are all things that big political campaigns already have in some form, but they usually all revolve around getting a single, big name candidate elected. It would be great to see a nonpartisan version that's as well designed, but that focuses more on local politics and smaller issues.\n\nIf something like this exists, I'd be interested to see it.",

How's this for a common sense law?  \"In the United States of America and all its territories,  all establishments selling drinks must refer to the drink by its size in ounces.\" \n\nNo more would you go to a fast food place and order a \"large\" only to be handed what you'd call a medium. You order your drink by size in ounces.  Instead of \"two large drinks and a kid's\", you order \"two 44's and a 20\". First,  this would help immensely for everyone to understand what they're getting. Second,  it would make it very easy for people to consider the price per ounce.  Third,  it just makes more sense.  Now instead of a small being ambiguous,  you'd know if the smallest drink offered was a 12 oz, a 16 oz or a 20 oz. If you know your kid never finishes a 20 oz, you can confidently order them a 16 and save yourself the money.  \n\nThe great thing about this is companies don't have to change what they're offering,  only how they refer to them.  Company A and Company B might both currently offer a \"small\", \"medium\", and \"large\" but they buy their cups from different places.  After our new law is implemented,  Company A has a 12, 20 and 28 and Company B has a 16, 24 and 32 and their \"jumbo\" is now known as a 44. \n\nObviously,  the actual amount of drink will always vary depending on the amount of ice that is added,  but at least everyone in the country could confidently order their drink knowing how big it's going to be.  \n\nWe could start a movement even to get the country to become aware of the situation and accept the new regulation. Maybe #NoMoreMedium or #BurgerFriesand32. \n\nLet's end the insanity and finally have something good come out of Washington DC.  Call your Congressman or Congresswoman today!

If user flags that a toilet is clogged, no toilet paper, or bathroom is messy, this notification will be sent to the manger or janitor, letting them know of problem. \n\n- Incentives for business or places. Highest bathroom in USA, Cleanest bathroom in Colorado.  Example of [this](http://www.popularmechanics.com/home/how-to/g330/18-strangest-bathrooms-in-the-world/)\n\nQuick process to review a bathroom. No signup process, that way you can just review the bathroom while your doing your business.  Be able to do written review with pictures and videos, but main point is to do a quick 5 star review. \n\nWhat do y'all think?\n\n\n",

All online resources would be free, but practical/physical resources would have small fees purely to keep things sustainable.\n\nThe general end goal is that certain marks of qualification could be acquired and be used by employers. It differs from the likes of Khan University as there would be an intentional government effort to integrate this into places of employment and the regular school system, so that the marks of qualification had value and were used. \n\nGenerally, the problem with education now is that it's too inflexible. College is expensive, location-bound and requires fixed dedication of time. While this specific solution might not work practically, the government effort should definitely be to broaden the means of earning qualifications.\n",

            "selftext": "If you were to reserve the top 30cm or so for mechanicals, you could integrate a decently sized pick and place robot armature inside a trailer or shipping compartment. Then add a feature that would allow it to crane out the main opening by 120cm or so. Now you have a truck trailer that can pick up packages and load itself. Only caveat may be something simple, like squaring up the box with the loader door - the logic built in does the rest.\n\nNow combine this with an algorithmic solver. Basically this would be something very similar to a Tetris solver, but knowing a couple more moves ahead. This should allow the pick and place machine to optimize a loading strategy that would allow it to work fairly quickly. (At least within constraints of allowable acceleration for the given packages.)\n\nThen if sorting the loadout order by most efficient delivery, a truck could theoretically load and unload itself. This means there is less risk of injury for people moving the load (just using pallet jacks or forklifts) as most of the main lifting and positioning in the trailer is automated.\n\nSeems like it's a solvable thing by combining some known technologies, and I'd think there'd be some demand for it. Anyone actually doing this or tried it yet?",

            "selftext": "I have an idea for just a completely anonymous dropbox on the web. It's pretty straightforward, you just go to the website. Click \"Start new box\", it generates a UUID for the box and redirects you to it. You can upload your files, photos, videos, notes, etc. All files will be encrypted when stored. You can add a password to the box if you'd like. \n\nUnlike Dropbox, Google Drive, etc. there's no sign ups or any other road blocks just quick, easy, and private storage. The boxes are more or less disposable so if you want to transfer some files to someone just give them the UUID and password and they can find your box and change the password, unlike Drive or Dropbox where it would still be nested in your account. Since there's no sign ups the boxes are anonymous, if you give the UUID to someone then they can't get your name, email, or anything because there's no name or email associated!\n\nBoxes would be capped at say 1GB but if you (or anyone since boxes aren't tied to a specific person) pays $X they can upgrade the size of the box.\n\nWould you use something like this? Do you think it would become overrun with things you shouldnt necessarily want to host (illegal stuff)?",

            "selftext": "How does everyone feel about a Todolist software that will lock your computer down until you finish your project or a certain time is done.\n\nIm sure you are wondering how can this be done?\n\nAs you might beware ransomware is a trick that will encode your files until you pay up. The same idea can be apply but you only need time or projects to free your files.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nSimple as any Todolist software you see online, you set up a certain time and the files will become unavailable for the user. Another way is until you check off that you finish the project.\n\nWhat if I need those files in a program?\n\nYes, i'm aware that each person has different files with different softwares that may cause Todolist application to unnecessary do. You are allow to whitelist any program that isn't disturbing you.\napplications that will 100% be blocked and unable to whitelist when using Todolist software:\n\n- Any website that is a game, video or news article. (picture of cats is included by keyword after looking at it for over 1 hour and stays that way forever now.)\n- Games we know and AAA games.\n- live wallpaper\n- music players if detected has the only running application for over 15 mins (it shouldn't be that long in the first place).\n- Video player if over 1 hour or if you insert it on a DVD player device.\n\nWhat it might not be a good software?\n\nLike like Todolist software in the internet, you can't force users to do stuff. They might set the time/project and later disable it because they can. As well as, the whole files becoming encoded which could cause files to corrupt (it would have been games that might have this problems more than anything). Many people will not likes being held hostage for a set time or until a project is needed, could become a problem when the news media picks it up. Lastly, paid subscription that promises to lock your computer on set time/project and remove disable button is not going to work well at all.\n\nWouldn't this be dangerous?\n\nNope because it is just targeting files not the Operating Software. Also there will be a killmode if needed by simply pressing on the power button for which it will ask to power computer down (that also works but never recommended), sleep (nothing happens), restart (never recommended) and shutdown the Todolist app. For operating systems that do not have this it will also work where the power off button is on your computer (i'm looking at you mac users).\n\nThat is my idea, I really don't care about someone stealing it because if anything happens with people's files they will be blaming it on them. As a side note, if this does become very popular to the point where news media isn't bashing it then maybe i can set up a kickstarter (no rewards other than lifetime of the subscription plan, sorry).",

The card has a dollar value on it, and you give it to the people on the side of the road.    They can then take it to ANY shelter or charity and exchange it for goods or services, e.g, food, shampoo, clothing, or as they climb the ladder to rent, assistance with bills, or whatever.   \n\nThis would discourage the folks simply collecting cash (as I've heard, some make hundreds of dollars in a couple of hours) just because it's a lucrative way to make money without working, or buying drugs.     \n\nThe charity could more actively track the needs in a given area, and see if what they are doing is actually working.

            "selftext": "One time I was watching Game of Thrones and during a scene where they killed one of the dire wolves I realized that I find violence against dogs for more unpleasant to watch than violence against humans. I can watch a movie where hundreds of men, women, and even children are killed without batting an eye but find myself sticking my fingers in my ears and closing my eyes when I know a scene where a dog gets hurt is coming, particularly if you can hear the dog whimper in pain.\n\nThe current rating systems for TV and film don't usually care much about dog violence, and I want to change that with a supplemental rating based solely on the level of dog violence viewers can expect.\n\nHere's my initial attempt at what such a rating system would look like:\n\nA - No violence against dogs, either actual or implied.\nB - Implied violence against dogs, but no visual or sound of dog injury.\nC - Visual of dog injury in film, but it is brief and not particularly explicit. Also includes films and shows with sounds of dogs being injured but no visual.\nD - Highly explicit visual of dogs injured with minor degrees of sound. Scene is relatively short.\nF - Highly explicit visuals and extensive sounds of dog injury. Scene is relatively long.\n\nThe system would also place numbers after the letter to indicate the number of incidents in the show or film. A rated films and shows have no number. The letter rating is based on the worst incident, but the number includes all incidents. So, for example, if a film had two scenes depicting dog violence, one that was a B and one that was a D, the final rating would be D2.",

If we can simulate neurons (we have done up to I believe 200,000 neurons have been simulated together at once. OR back to the original idea, these digital \"stem cells\" could basically be rearranged automatically to suit the specific hardware needs and alter them on the fly. Think of it like a bunch of rearrangeable circuitry cubes that can alter the shape of the circuitry on each side and also interact with nearby cubes by connnecting with them to form more complex circuits that can be built upon each other to emulate the circuitry of a GPU or whathaveyou and change it up often and even have an automated part of the computer do this for you . All it would have to determine is what I am trying to do (game, render a simulation, mine cryptocurrency, perform certain scientifically heavy simulations or whatever extreme computers and super computers are used for. This is not something I believe is currently achievable in the near future (like perhaps before I get too old, but not like in a decade or two probably ya feel. But I definitely think that a major revision needs to be made to the current way we go about computing because the prevailing architecture hasn't changed much in a while and sometimes for great change to happen, you have to kind of start from scratch with the knowledge of the older models' strengths andn weaknesses in mind to design a most effective system.

Don't ask me why, its just a strange \"rule\" that has been impressed upon me.\n\nSo, I can't tell anyone about my dreams, yet, I'd like to be able to prove to others that my dreams really were prophetic, after the prophecy has unfolded and come true.\n\nI was thinking of writing some blog posts, make them private, and when I reveal them publicly, the timestamp will show that my dreams really were a prediction.\n\nI also need a way to prove to people that I didn't edit my posts. I tried Facebook, and while facebook shows the user the edit history, it doesn't let the public see whether a post was edited or not.\n\nLastly, I also have to prove to people that I'm not simply listing all kinds of predictions in the hopes that one of them will turn out to be true, revealing that one publicly and sweeping the \"failed\" ones under the carpet.\n\n\nWhat methods do you think I should use to record my prophecies?

            "selftext": "One night I started thinking about running for POTUS.\nThen I came about with this framework of ideas.  The most important one is number 11.  See what you think. This is a rough draft, the main focus is to keep things simple and practical.  Its not based on any political ideology just trying to make the best out of what is available.\n\n here we go...\n    1. Free healthcare (paid by reducing military spending)\n    2. Free college (paid by reducing military spending)\n    3. 34 hour work week. \n    4. 5 weeks paid vacation from work. \n    5. 4 year limited terms for congressmen and senators.  It's not a career it's a service to the people. \n    6. Free internet (education)\n    7. Minimum wage $12.00 dollars\n    8. psychological evaluation for anyone that is running for office.\n    9. End all lobbying, make it illegal.\n    10. Go after the drug users more than the dealers. \n    11. Create a voting system that requires every civilian to be proactive, to demonstrate their civil duties, in issues that affect the entire population. (examples:  healthcare, immigration, education, yearly vacations, etc, etc)\n12. The voting system would be based on a 65/35 voting outcome.\n13. Use the current technology to id everyone (fingerprints/iris scanning) for the voting agendas.  \n14. Limit my entire campaign funding to 1 million dollars. No single donation can exceed $500.00\n15. Provide clear and concise plan of action and campaign mostly through live channels on the internet.\n16. Hold me accountable for items in my agenda. If after 2 years there is progress I would resign.\n\nThere are many more things I have in mind but will come at a later date.  Again this is a rough draft and the goal is to simplify our current policies for the better of the people and not the few.",

            "selftext": "I want some idea or feedback on this website please. I personally think is quite insnovative and I just want to see what is the major drawback. With all the benefit and seem so risk free, what is it that can make this better.\n\nKatdream.com\n\nIn the nutshell, it is a site that everyone contribute towards an item, once it reach the threshold a drawing begin and draw one of the contributor as a lucky winner. If you think about it, it is a new eco-economy concept which we aggregate little money from many people and help one another at getting items they want for fraction of the cost. I'm sure everyone has things they want and have some extra dollar or two they can save or spent on something that give potentially higher return than giving an extra dollar tips or drinking from starbucks. As many business or wealth making experts (rich dad, Peng Joon) has said the difference between rich and poor is where and how you spend your money. Spending money here is also helping another person everytime even if you don't win and your odds or much higher than a lottery. \n\n\nFurthermore, there are practical ways from this site to play totally for free and it is not the lame old surveys, ads, and trying apps out. It is something that focus on engaging others and all is to aim to be easy and quick. Example, getting the most likes from social media can win something and that is a very easy task and furthermore it is a way to keep you social media friends engage and create a practical topic that all benefit from. There are many frequent promotion to earn free points. It doesn't require credit card.\n\nThe ongoing promotion of superkat member and buyback further enhance profitability where you have good potential to get item at lower price and resale. Buyback option is a fallback of your mishap, where when you spend increments  of 25% on a item for 6 times without winning give you a option to buy it at 40% off the posted value to buy it directly. When put into perspective, if you spend 25% on an item, your odds of winning is 25% and the likelihood of winning it in 4 times is pretty high, even if you are not lucky this time you can fallback on the buyback option. Superkat give you double event rewards and 3% points back and one time less on buyback option.",

If anyone knows let me know and I would probably pay for it.\n\nPerhaps it could be extended to watch for how much a window's text or image has changed; for example if you are waiting for something to start or for a status icon to change.\n\nThe app would be invoked with a key shortcut for example, then if you click on a window it would say \"Would you like to watch this window?\". You could be notified through text message via Twillio or just a popup notification. I think there are application-specific frameworks that probably do this; some apps do it by default (Windows Defender tells me when it's done scanning.) Some apps allow me to run a script when it's done, but there aren't too many that do that.\n\nPossible uses:\n\n- waiting for a file transfer to complete\n\n- a really long render in Maya\n\n- something is finished printing\n\n- something is finished downloading",

It would be similar to how Christian Mingle is for Christians but only very Christian people would want to use it. There might not be enough people to support it in a lot of areas, but I live in DC and people here take politics very seriously.

            "selftext": "This will be one of those 'Faker' apps. This is essentially an app that contains fake templates of apps where you can interact with the app, and rather than the app reacting the normal way, its reacts in the way the user formats it. i.e Instead of a fitness app accurately displaying you gaining 2 pounds, our app displays the user gaining 15. This should be believable enough to be used for film, yet simple enough for an everyday person who just wants to joke around. This can also have a developer friendly feature, where fellow developers can create their own templates to submit under their username, under their account. This will be so that it can create a community, a larger user base and it can be used as a platform for talented developers as their account will have a lot of great submissions. I have more ideas, as I have thought about this for a while, so reply or Pm me if you like the idea if you want to use and take the idea further, as I have a full .txt file being constantly updated with ideas for the app.",

This would ensure that even on EDGE, you could send your location instantly to 911. [I read in an article](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/02/22/cellphone-911-lack-location-data/23570499/) that most 911 calls end before the emergency dispatcher can get the location, because the caller is either unable to speak or has been compromised. My system would ensure that the moment the cellphone handshakes with 911, it would just immediately spam the other end's higher frequency (Maybe somewhere in the 21Khrtz or 8Hrtz, well beyond human hearing) with data, so the callers don't hear that classic noise you used to hear from dialup.\n\nHowever, this is just a concept. I could write the baseband on some shitty Android dev phone for our prototype, but I would need electrical engineers, signal engineers and hardware engineers to help me along the way and prototype this thing in to a patentable system, or we could even give it the fuck-it adjustment and open source this shit, so 911 centers around America have 0 reason other than laziness to implement it.\n\nWhat do you guys think?",

By connecting a multitude of 'empty' alkaline batteries in series, one should be able to generate enough current to charge one rechargeable battery?\n\nGood for the environment, and since the power is already paid for and would be discarded otherwise, it's essentially 'free'?",

With all the benefit and seem so risk free, what is it that can make this better.\nKatdream.com\nIn the nutshell, it is a site that everyone contribute towards an item, once it reach the threshold a drawing begin and draw one of the contributor as a lucky winner. If you think about it, it is a new eco-economy concept which we aggregate little money from many people and help one another at getting items they want for fraction of the cost. I'm sure everyone has things they want and have some extra dollar or two they can save or spent on something that give potentially higher return than giving an extra dollar tips or drinking from starbucks. As many business or wealth making experts (rich dad, Peng Joon) has said the difference between rich and poor is where and how you spend your money. Spending money here is also helping another person everytime even if you don't win and your odds or much higher than a lottery. \nFurthermore, there are practical ways from this site to play totally for free and it is not the lame old surveys, ads, and trying apps out. It is something that focus on engaging others and all is to aim to be easy and quick. Example, getting the most likes from social media can win something and that is a very easy task and furthermore it is a way to keep you social media friends engage and create a practical topic that all benefit from. There are many frequent promotion to earn free points. It doesn't require credit card.\nThe ongoing promotion of superkat member and buyback further enhance profitability where you have good potential to get item at lower price and resale. Buyback option is a fallback of your mishap, where when you spend increments of 25% on a item for 6 times without winning give you a option to buy it at 40% off the posted value to buy it directly. When put into perspective, if you spend 25% on an item, your odds of winning is 25% and the likelihood of winning it in 4 times is pretty high, even if you are not lucky this time you can fallback on the buyback option. Superkat give you double event rewards and 3% points back and one time less on buyback option.\n",

I propose that a Park should be opened where controversial statues and monuments depicting Communist, Confederate, Racist, and other controversial figures could be sent to and it could have various \"sectors\" so as to unrest when someone who wants to pay their respects to Lenin bumps into to someone honoring Jefferson Davis.

            "selftext": "I've had this idea for a while, I wonder if anyone has tried it- they should have a metal toothed track in the middle of road lanes, and a retractable gear wheel on cars that can lock in. This would give you a direct one to one connection with the ground with perfect traction. You could then use hydraulic or magnetic brakes and force stops before impacts. Basically, get around the need to create traction on the tires. The same wheel could be used to traction during acceleration and passing through low traction areas like black ice. With cars like Tesla's line, you could have enough torque to get up to speed as fast as comfort will allow- and the system could be driven electrically and disengaged at cruise.\n\nA similar system could be implemented in a lateral configuration and perhap produce emergency lateral force to avoid crashes without forcing a full stop.\n\nI called an \"external pinioned maneuvering system\" and would require a \"rack road.\" (Similar to a rack railroad but with teeth allowing for multidirectional force.)\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rack_railway",

So all of you are familiar with Youtube\u2019s ads. If they\u2019re longer than 5 seconds, you\u2019re gonna skip it. So why do businesses use ads longer than 5 seconds? I\u2019ve been seeing a growing trend of businesses making 5 second ads, that are clear and get to the point, and since they can\u2019t be skipped (The skip button takes 5 seconds to load) the people viewing it get to see the full thing. And if it shows up often enough, they\u2019ll realize that they can\u2019t skip yours so they won\u2019t bother focusing on the skip button to load, they\u2019ll more than likely just watch the ad. I actually tend to like those businesses better as well, because they are in tune with the wants of the people that would be buying from them, and they deliver. I actually started buying Vitamin Water *just because their ad was 5 seconds*. It does a lot more than people would think, so I decided to try and get it out there a little more. Not only is it more convenient for us viewers, but you get more money, because it costs less, and more people will see your what product. \n",

            "selftext": "This is just an idea, so please indulge me. \n\nWe can stop larger cargo trucks from driving into hordes of people like what happened with the Nice terror attack by reprogramming the Black Box that are required to be inside all trucks. In Danish television a few weeks ago, an inspiration story that was shown on the news covered a group of people that made a modification to the Black Box that made it so the truck couldn't drive more than a few hundred meters away from its owner before the truck hit the brakes on its own since the owner has a sensor on him that shuts down the truck if it moves to far away. You can probably see what the problem is with that (kill the owner and take said sensor with you or even the body of the owner if you are too busy to search him), but there could be another way.\n\nSince we know that the technology exists for trucks to automatically brake and slow down given a certain condition, like driving too far away from a sensor separate from the truck, it's not unrealistic to assume we can reprogram it to brake under a different condition.\n\nThe condition I propose would be if the truck received a remote signal from a piece of machinery that only the police have access to. Basically, the idea is to give police officers a piece of equipment that can, via remote control, ideally from extended ranges, make a truck slow down and make it so that any given stolen truck would not be able to actually reach speeds where pedestrians would not be able to get out of the way. Police officers with said equipment would be stationed on rooftops or small towers in areas where people are most at risk, like at festivals, celebrations, or in spaces where lots of people tend to gather.\n\nYou might ask: \"Why not just make it stop entirely?\", and that's where the difficulties with the idea come in. First, it bases its effective off the fact that the Government have to spend a ton of money to make it so EVERY truck in any given country the idea is implemented in to be modified with the piece of technology that makes the police able to stop trucks from a distance. Second, the ability to actually stop a vehicle remotely might be abused by hackers, who could easily hack into a truck driving on the highway and make it stop instantly, causing mass destruction. Because of the second issue being a very real possibility, I would propose to make it so the truck doesn't entirely stop, but moves at only a few km/h so that a truck can move to the side of the road if it is indeed hacked, and might be a necessary sacrifice we have to take to make sure that truck drivers aren't endangered by malicious hackers, even though it means a truck can't be completely stopped if it tries to ram into pedestrians. Third, it can't actually stop smaller vehicles at all, so the idea can only really be used to limit heavy trucks specifically, and not vans or ordinary cars like we have just seen with both Barcelona and Charlottesville, so it's not an all-purpose solution, and only works to limit the worst possible scenario of a giant vehicle driving into people, and not smaller ones.\n\nThis idea can't stop ALL trucks from performing terror attacks. What it can do is drastically reduce the danger of a terrorist quickly stealing someone's truck and driving it into a huge group of people, since, A) the largest groups of people will have police with the device in hand that can stop incoming trucks if they see them coming, B) most terror attacks are spur of the moment and not planned through, which means the majority of potential attackers will not have time to remove the Black Box before they try to ram into people or the truck is reported stolen by the owner.\n\nI have a few more ideas regarding the Black Box and how it can be reprogrammed to ensure the safety of both truck owners and pedestrians, but I haven't thought them completely through yet and will thus just only mention the remote control device idea. I'm a 20 year old Danish kid with no entrepreneurial knowledge or any idea if I could and who I would pitch an idea like this to, so if you do know who to present this idea to, please feel free to take it for yourself and present it to said person. If you believe the idea may be plausible and know where to take it or who to talk to to make it become a reality, please do so. I would feel guilty if something happened that me or my idea could have stopped but didn't do so because I kept the idea for myself.",

So I read a shower thought: \"we live in a world where community service is a way of punishment\"\n\nI do agree that this is weird.\n\nTalking about health care and community services life is pretty unfair: There is this person never taking care about others because she or he is totally focused on money and helping an older person is not rewarded financially. When this person becomes ill the help of others can be bought with the money that might never have helped others.\n\nAnd on the other side: a person working in the kindergarten or a hospital. Bad salary although taking care of the kids of the rich people. Spending life in service for the community. And when this person is in need of a treatment there might be no money.\n\nSo: how about splitting up money into an industrial and a community currency?\n\nA Community Coin. Community servants obtain an additional payment in these coins. Sending your child to a kindergarten cannot be paid directly with the industrial money. You have to exchange it for the community money or work a little bit in the sector...\n\nAny opinions?\n\n",

The lid has a rubber pressure release valve that opens if the internal pressure is higher than a certain threshold.\n\nInside the container is a small reservoir for clean water. Microwaving the container will boil the water in this reservoir, and release steam. The steam warms up and moisturizes your food.\n\nToo often I've put dinner leftovers into my lunch box, and it comes out really dry.

So if you apply and are rejected from 4 different cards you've already hurt your credit and are no closer to getting a card.\n\nI think there should be a service where you can put in your information and select all or some subset of credit card companies. Then the service makes **one** hard pull on your credit and passes the information to these companies.

This receipt, if you are organised and have the wherewithal to hold onto them, can be useful. Yes, receipts can be emailed to you but it takes time to use those clunky POS systems to enter you email and then you have to go and retrieve the receipt from your inbox. For millions of Americans though, these receipts are disposed of and provide no real use to the end consumer. What if a technology existed where NFC (near-field communication) was used to transmit your receipt to your phone in a specific format and then placed into a category such as \"Grocery Expenses\" or \"Entertainment\". This would allow the end consumer to track their spending while also eliminating the need for paper receipts. If that isn't possible, you could have the NFC open an app to download the receipt over cellular data, but this may be an issue when you're in a store and there is no cellular service. \n\nHere is an example of a simple receipt.\n\nDatetime:  2/3/4 12:00\n\nBrick and Mortar Store # 4444\nProduct 1:              6.50\nProduct 2:              1.50\nProduct 3:              20.90\n\nTotal:                  &lt;math&gt;\n\nreceiptID:   0987654321\n\nThe receipt above is roughly 164 bytes. 1Byte = 8bits. so 1312b, 1.312kb @\"106 kbit/s to 424 kbit/s\" transfers in ~1ms.\n\nYou could shave off additional time by having a standard/protocol/microformat for the receipts and/or using binary instead of plaintext. So in regards to the time it would take at a POS system for this to happen, it would be minimal or slightly longer for larger receipts.\n\nReceipts are not that information dense.\n\nLet me know your thoughts and suggestions.

I don't travel much though.\n\nThe screen inside the elevator would be essentially the same as the ones outside the elevator. Instead of just picking Up or Down when approaching elevator, you'd choose your floor right away. The elevator might then be able to route more efficiently by knowing where people are going before they get on, and there'd be less waiting in the elevator for other passengers to find their floor.\n\nEach button could have text beside it, such as what departments were on that floor (\"cafeteria\", \"Accounting\"), or highlight an event that was occurring on that floor (\"Smith-Devos wedding reception\"), or logos of businesses on that floor. Elevator traffic would be tracked, so the buttons for the most common destinations (from the current floor) would be larger or highlighted.\n\nFor the vision disabled, there would probably also have to be physical buttons, but perhaps voice commands would be enough. The elevator would listen for things like \"floor three\", \"third floor\", or \"lobby\" and then tell the passenger what it heard and maybe ask for confirmation.\n\nThe screens on the landings could warn people who were waiting for the elevator that passengers were going to be disembarking on that floor, so then you'd know if you needed to stand back or could wait right in front of the door. In theory cameras could even show you who's waiting, which might be nice for security reasons too.\n\nAnother feature might be face recognition or similar, so if I come to the elevator every morning around 7:50, the elevator knows to deliver me to my usual floor without me even saying or doing anything.",

            "selftext": "After seeing today's TIL about [2 guys in a Cessna setting the record](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/6vbbfn/til_that_in_1958_two_pilots_flew_an_aircraft_for/), I thought about how to break that record today. \n\nFirst I thought that just by looking at the TIL, you could simply put up a helicopter attaching to a fuel tank on the ground. Then I went onto the idea of having a [helicopter with a rectenna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDy94xgEhEw) hanging from the bottom. Then you just beam energy at the helicopter. But why not just go with a powered sailplane?\n\nUsing this [electric powered glider](http://www.pipistrel.si/plane/taurus-electro/overview), you could maintain flight for quite a while with much less energy requirements than an old Cessna. We're looking at a 30kw continuous (40kw takeoff) vs a 108kw motor, with a glide ratio of [1:41](http://www.pipistrel.si/plane/taurus-electro/technical-data) vs [1:9](https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/2999/how-far-can-airplanes-glide). This means that you don't necessarily need to run the motor the whole time, and could just give it small bursts to maintain altitude.\n\nYou can install the rectenna into the wing since fiberglass will be invisible to microwaves. This weight will impact glide ratios but it will still be quite high. A protective metal shield around the cockpit area will keep the pilots safe. Fly it during the summer and you will use less fuel as it can use thermals to maintain altitude during the day. The microwave system designed by NASA showed a [54% efficiency.](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/141357/?reload=true) for beaming DC-DC power.\n\nYou could probably redesign this to be large enough so that it could have a toilet system installed and maybe a hook so that it can swoop close to the ground and grab additional rations and water. Now we just need to find a couple of people foolish enough to want to sit in a plane for 90 days. ",

The issue my organization is faced with pertains to being able to **uniquely identify a single parcel from a heap of other parcels**. Solving this issue requires parcels to be sorted, stored and transferred in a specific sequence - which is currently not the case. Additionally, when the delivery person arrives at the customer\u2019s doorstep, identifying the right parcel to be delivered at that address involves a time consuming process of manually sorting through a heap of parcels - one at a time.\n\n**Challenge**\n\nIn simple terms, I am looking to come up with an innovative solution to help them quickly and easily identify a specific parcel. The solution can be IT-based or non IT-based. However, a crucial aspect is that the specific parcel should possess the ability to alert delivery personnel to its presence and precise location.\nFor example, the solution can be IoT-based - such as attaching a reusable, rugged sensor that is small - and cheap - to the parcels. Alternatively, it can be a sort of \u2018magic\u2019 ink that, when sprayed on a parcel, adds a specific color for easy identification. It could be a type of smart fabric. \n\nIdeas? :)",

            "selftext": "Some time ago, there was an obsession with products that could hook up to other products. Kitchen aid stand mixers are a great example. But there were also products meant to be driven by a drill, etc.  The tides turned for some reason toward standalone products. \n\nI liked the old way because everything took up less room. My idea is instead of a standalone popcorn popper, you have a housing that connects to a heat gun. This is nice because heat guns have many other home uses. You can upgrade your popper by upgrading your heat gun. \n\nThe popper itself would fold up for storage. All metal construction for dishwasher safe-ness. Minimal material for low cost. ",

We could make five new states, and just make them apart of the U.S.  Instantly make all Mexicans U.S. citizens, and start taxing them.  Most of them want to come here anyway to escape the violence, and find jobs.  It would be a lot easier to fight the drug cartels if they were in our jurisdiction.  No more immigration or trade problems.  We would save a ton of money on law enforcement.  Once the cartels are gone, the tourism industry would skyrocket.

            "selftext": "Hello Lightbulb!\n\nAll the current task managers I see are just lists, lists, and lists. Nothing is really *visual*. And the ones that market themselves as visual are really just tasks lists in a larger shaped box.\n\nSo I've thought of a new task manager that is purely visual. Think of it as a `bubble planner`. \n\n---\n\n[Here](https://imgur.com/a/j0sH1) is a simple layout of what the Bubble Planner would look like.\n\n**Main features:**\n\n- Your tasks enclosed in bubbles that slowly expand the longer they are uncompleted.\n\n- As the bubbles expand, the larger encompassing bubble also expands, providing a visual cue to know when you are too behind on your work.\n\n**Other important features:**\n\n- Small tasks can have smaller starting bubble size. \n\n- Task bubbles can be grouped by putting them inside another bubble.\n\n**Pros and Unique Uses:**\n\n- You can choose which tasks to do based on their size. It's VISUAL SOLUTION, HALLELUJAH!\n\n- Small tasks don't get ignored like in other task apps but slowly grow overtime. This way, it promotes good balance between priority/non priority tasks.\n\n\n---\n\n\n**Based on this:**\n\n- How many of you think that this is promising and would potentially be a paying member?\n- How many of you would want this for free but with ads? \n\nI'm trying to gauge the interest first before starting anything so I hope you don't mind me asking.\n\nThanks for listening and I'm looking forward to your comments.",

Water is pulled up tubes by capillary action, or the tendency for surface tension to pull against gravity.\n\nIf one were to tap a spring-pipe into a hillside, divert that water into a small waterwheel generator and direct it back to the base of the hill, would the water pull itself back up the hill to the location where the spring-tube can drain the water back out to continue the cycle indefinitely?",

This is meant to be *satisfying*, not *realistic*.\n\n1.\tLebron is obviously super strength, and his name/aesthetic is the King. Can push people out of the way, jump super high and throw the ball down, or pass the ball super fast so it is unable to be stolen.\n2.\tRuss is \u2018Kid Lightning\u2019, he is able to charge up and then take off with super speed and electricity trail where he can take off and dunk over people.\n3.\tSteph is the ice man and a sharpshooter. He can freeze time when he shoots for increased accuracy, and also freeze defenders\n4.\tIT can shrink his body and dribble under people legs where he is very difficult to defend\n5.\tKyrie can slow time and make perfect reactions to the defense.\n6.\tKawhi is a stylized thief, he can perfectly pick the pockets of people, or maybe can turn invisible on defense\n7.\tDeandre Jordan can grow his body to block the shit out of people and dunk, but it becomes harder to shoot for him as the hoop becomes smaller\n8.\tGiannis can super-stretch his body to extreme lengths\n9.\tKD is a robot, he can extend his limbs as well to compete with Giannis, but he also has a mechanized shot release that is extremely accurate\n10.\tGordon Hayward is a lucky leprechaun. His moves start to work more effectively against CPU-controlled players and his shots go in more often\n11.\tJames Harden is the fire god, he gets hot the better he plays and starts having fire trails, his beard turns into fire\n12.\tLonzo is the attention vacuum, he can start dancing anywhere on the court, and the opposing players must look at him. Or maybe when he has the ball, so that he can throw juicy dimes\n13.\tDemarcus cousins is the hulk basically. Gets angry and strong and can push people out of the way.\n14.\tAnthony Davis can control the minds of others with his unibrow\n15.\tJohn Wall can use purple magic to use special passes or moves that are difficult to defend\n16.\tDamian Lillard is the darkness kid, controls darkness and shadows to change what the court looks like, and swiftly attack the rim\n17.\tChris Paul is the \u2018good guy\u2019, helps everyone else on the team play better and has special passes\n18.\tDraymond Green is an acrobatic guerilla warrior, strong on defense and acrobatically can block the shot or steal the ball in style, like doing cartwheels and shit. Can dish dimes too\n19.\tJimmy Butler can magnetize himself to an opponent on defense and use magnets on offense as well\n20.\tDemar Derozen can turn into a tornado to maneuver the court\n21.\tKAT is extremely nimble, can flex around in weird ways to strategically get around defenders\n22.\tDerrick Rose is a Halloween skeleton. He is hella good at first but people can break him into bones where he must leave the game\n23.\tCarmello is a juice box. He can shoot juicy shots and play well until he runs out of juice\n24.\tPorzingus is a huge tree, and grows throughout the game as he plays well\n25.\tJeremy Lin can calculate perfect angles at extreme speed\n26.\tBlake Griffin can create earthquakes with his dunking\n27.\tThe rest of the spurs (besides Kawhi) can be perfectly organized and orchestrated like minions by Coach Pop, and easily run plays on command\n28.\tZach Lavine can use special dunks\n29.\tDwayne Wade can turn silver once per game and use flawless execution\n30.\tDevon Booker can create sandstorms that hurt everyone\u2019s vision while he scores\n31.\tThe Philadelphia big 3 can play really well and have mini superpowers, (strength, passing, moves), but their energy starts at maximum and goes down as they use moves or as other players damage them until they are weak\n32.\tKyle Lowry gets special moves that are kind of mediocre\n33.\tKlay is an army soldier, can use a scope to shoot at the rim\n34.\tKevin Love has a valentine\u2019s aesthetic and players \u2018fall in love\u2019 with him and stop playing as well\n35.\tJoakim Noah is a slime monster. He leaves a trail of slime that can stick other plays to slow them down and has special slime moves\n36.   Paul George becomes 'Thor' basically and becomes stronger with a lightning aesthetic\n37.   Vince Carter grows significantly with age, becoming an old man, and slows down but his 4 other teammates harness his power to become faster and better\n38.   Dirk turns into two players as he shoots, decreasing the chances of his shot getting blocked\n\nThe trick of the game would be that the moves would be satisfying to use unlike NBA 2k, customize-able, and balanced between offense and defense unlike NBA Jam. Oh, and it would be split screen for multiplayer, as the camera would follow which ever player you control from their perspective. This would be why certain moves (like Lonzo Ball's distraction) would be effective. It would forcibly move your camera.",

It could really help out the community and I'd love to hear your honest thoughts. \n\nThe website would be a marketplace of live online classes for creative millennials and young adults. You would use group video chat to connect students and teachers from around the world. \n\nA big problem with learning online is that the experience is lonely, boring and frustrating since you're learning alone without an instructor and classmates. The best way to learn is with others. Social experiences enhance learning and nothing can replace a great teacher or exploring ideas with fellow peers! \n\nHere's how the site would work:\n\n1) Browse for a live group class based on needs, schedule and interests.\n2) Enroll and pay one-time fee for class.\n3) Attend the class and learn via a live video group chat.\n\nHere's a prototype to convey the idea: https://invis.io/ENDE1LGXT\n\nWhat are your thoughts and feedback on this? **Brutally Honest Feedback** is totally encouraged! :)",

These would be used more as references, perhaps indicating the best way to go about learning something. The usecase would be this: You're confused by all the resources teaching javascript, so you go on this and see a guide called intro to javascript that has been upvoted 2,000 times. There's a pretty good chance that this would be a great guide outlining resources and ways to get started, so you're set! I think it would a great tool for those starting out learning various disciplines, especially computer science.",
