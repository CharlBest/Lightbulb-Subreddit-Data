Well, so lets make an index of quality of life based on that. It's also based on the [QALY](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality-adjusted_life_year), where you give a lower value to time spent sick.\n\nSo here is how it would work: 1 hour of leisure would have a value of 1. 1 hour doing something you are obligated to do, such as work, commuting, chores, etc, would be worth less, depending on how unwilling people are to do it.\n\nI think that would be a good way to measure quality of life across countries (as HDI does), and it would be a good indicator for the impact of some government decisions, particularly those involving transportation, labor and health.\n\nSo, tell me what you think of it, or if something was unclear, ask.",

The robot's head and top part of his body would be the only visible part, like in a skype call, though it wouldn't be a 'real' robot, just a 3D model that would move its head naturally and talk through my speakers/earbuds. The robot would completely stay in character as a robot, and may or may not remember details from previous conversations (depending on user preference). I could just talk to him about anything - how I feel, what happened that day, maybe ask for advice, stuff like that. \n\nI know that there would at least be quite a few people that would want to be able to do that, to be able to share their feelings freely to someone who does not judge anything about them and cannot hurt them in any way. With something like this, it would feel just like talking to someone else. \n\nIn my head, I imagine the robot looking, sounding, and acting like Legion from Mass Effect, because he is my all time favorite robot and I would love to spend time chatting with a robot with his image and personality.",

News about the world would come from travellers and adventurers, and you would create quests to give out to heroes in order to sustain your business.\n\n\n\nExample: One of your trade routes has been cutoff, a traveler tells you, and you are running out of wares. You hire a young man to find out what has happened, and fix the problem. He may or may not suceed. If it goes badly, you might have to resort to criminal business.\n\n\n\n\nI imagine it being kind of like a sims game, but in which the player himself is more relevant. Perhaps this could simply be a part of a bigger fantasy city-building game, where you could expand and create other stores in town. Perhaps all of these features will be in the next elder scrolls game!",

Then one of the guests finds the hosts parents dead inside the house (something that happened IRL), and people start getting murdered at the party. Standard slasher movie; kind of like \"and then there were none\" for a modern age as everyone at the party turns against each other. However the difference with this film is that all of the footage is from the party's guests filming it with their phones.\n\nHere's the big twist. The party ends with a first person shot of the last surviving guest (the host?) being murdered, and their phone being stolen. Then some deranged text pops up \"Those people were all sinners. I was justified in what I did. With this film I cobbled together, maybe you'll understand, and I can show myself. It hasn't been easy making this film on the run and keeping evidence out of it; I may have been a little sloppy.\" You just watched the killer's manifesto.\n\nSo the idea is that you can figure out who the killer is through clues hidden in the editing, and fan theories as to the nature of the killer. There'll be all kinds of clues that it was one of the \"dead\" characters, and possibly suggestions that it was another character that edited themself out of the footage. Maybe there can be a sequel movie (a faux-documentary of a police investigation, maybe) in which the killer from this movie is revealed.",

            "selftext": "Today I was watching an youtube video when my internet connection suddenly started to become shitty. The video that was in 720p didn't even play seamlessly at 320p.\n\nSo as usual, I clicked the [download button](http://i.imgur.com/pkTU3jD.png) (Provided by Youtube Center), checked the link at [my downloads](http://i.imgur.com/8wfaSkS.png), copied it, and put it into a [download manager](http://i.imgur.com/TxlLM9y.png) (Orbit), then opened the file that was still downloading with a [media player](http://i.imgur.com/oGBw70M.png) (Media Player Classic) and started watching the video at 720p. Oh, the joy of technology! \n\nWhile I was doing this I noticed something, why do we have to still stream videos on the fly, why do download managers are faster than youtube itself? Why did I had to do all this just to watch a video?\n\nSo I propose to you my friends, my [Lightbulb](http://www.dionlabel.com/tl_files/dion/images/Ashley's%20Blog/lightbulb_cartoon.jpg)^^^please_don't_ban_me. It may not be for everyone, but god, how I wish this existed!\n\nThe ideia is simple: Make everything simpler.\n\nLet's say you watch videos on Vimeo and Youtube. You do it daily, and on the same channels, so you come home, turn on your PC (Or HTPC), and there it is, your subscribed channels from any site, all in one program. You open a video of your favorite channel, VSauce, and it starts playing in your favorite player, in Full HD, even if you internet connection can't even stream 480p. There are no Ads, and you just sit back and relax while you watch the video, but you don't want to carefully select the next video to be played when the current video is over, so you select the TV Mode, and another video is ready to be played when the current one is over. It's simple, It's configured by you to play what you want, and how you want. You are a happy person! \n\nAnd it's simple to be made too! (In my point of view at least)\nThe program just parses your subscription, starts downloading the videos in the setting that you choose, using whatever bandwidth you allowed it to use. When you come home, you have all the videos pre-loaded in one place to be watched. Usually internet videos use common formats that can be played with most of the players, and it even helps the hosting site, it can distribute the bandwidth more evenly (Well, I guess it doesn't help so much, because they don't have their \"evil\" AD money MUHUAHUAHUAHUA).\n\nSome example of programs that do some part of my idea are:\n\n* Almost any download manager\n\n* JDownloader (Decrypt the link to a downloadable one, and downloads it, it has plugins for everything!)\n\n* MPC, Windows Media Player, VLC \n\nAnd some features that it may have:\n\n* Cat Mode!\n\n* Porn Mode!\n\n* Easier way to see and manage your subscriptions and their videos! (Including, but not limited to: Ways to sort your videos! Animated thumbnails! Filters and search mode! Groups of subscriptions!)\n\n* Multi-plataform!\n\n* Multi-plataform porn mode!\n\n* May or not be open source!\n\n* Maybe a ripoff of other products!\n\n* Skins and Themes!\n\nSo, tell me what you think, It's this as cool as I imagine it to be or am I a dreamy nerd who needs to move this to /r/CrazyIdeas? (Or it somehow exists? If so, please show me!)",

            "selftext": "I can't decide if this belongs here or in /r/crazyideas. Because it is a crazy idea, but at the same time, part of me thinks it makes perfect sense. \n\n\nThis would be a university in which every course for every major can be tested out of. Sure, there'd be some type of fee and you'd still pay tuition as an active \"student\" but if you know your shit, you should be given the chance to prove it and then you should be handed a diploma, in my opinion. \n\n\nThere's problems already I should address.\n\n\n**How would this even work?** Well every course will be taught as well, just like normal, but a couple weeks before the start of class, they hold the test (sort of a suped up version of a final exam.) If you fail the test, you have to take the class if you want credit for your degree. If you pass, you get full credit for it, and you can enroll in a higher class using it as a prerequisite. This would allow people to learn some subjects at home, and reduce the cost of their education by getting a lot of unnecessary classes (for them) out of the way. \n\n\n**The school wouldn't make any money if everyone just tests through their whole degree.** Well, first of all, these tests would not be easy. To preclude the complaints that this is simply a diploma mill or that you can pass a class without really knowing the material, these would be comprehensive, difficult, and long tests. Not so hard as to prevent anyone from passing, but hard enough to prevent anyone from thinking of it as the \"easy A.\" \n\n\n**Wouldn't some classes just not be able to be taught if most people pass the test?** Well, in theory, this system would allow for higher than normal enrollment by factoring in the expected percentage of people who would test out. Sort of how airlines overbook planes, because a certain number of people always miss a flight. So if a test historically has 50% passing... first of all it needs to be made more difficult anyway, but also, you can enroll more than a class can hold because you know some of them won't be taking it. \n\n\n**Would the tests be free?** I haven't decided, but probably not, although I wouldn't expect them to be too expensive either. However, if there is a fee, it would be much less than paying for the class anyway. Maybe it could even be refunded to you if you fail, I can't decide on this. \n\n\n***\n\n\nThere's more to this idea, but that's the main part of it. I would also make all programs' course schedules available to every student, and cross reference every schedule to find degrees that have high numbers of like courses, so students know up front which degrees can be easily earned simultaneously, especially if they can test out of certain courses (say, a Bachelor's in Spanish and another in Spanish Literature could be earned together.) I don't know how much schools already do this, but at my fictional school, these combinations would be well-researched already and advisors would present them as options to incoming students. \n\n\nAnd yes, if you're capable of it, you ought to be able to take a series of tests and get your entire degree without ever setting foot in a classroom. Who cares if you learned math from textbooks you bought on Amazon and by watching Khan Academy videos? If you know the stuff, you get credit and you get your degree if you're sufficiently educated.

            "selftext": "Parallax is the basic idea that the further an object is away from you, the smaller it looks. As an object approaches you, it gets bigger and bigger. When driving and looking out the window, the objects closer to you move faster than the ones farther away.\nBut what if that wasn't the case? What if, when objects came closer to you, they appeared smaller? And as they increased their distance to you, they appeared larger?\n\nIf this was applied to our own world, the world would look extremely strange. Basically, the objects with the biggest distance to you would appear the largest, and maybe that would be some giant star far out in the universe. You probably wouldn't be able to see much more than that star, as it's distance to you is mind-numbingly large compared to the distance between you and practically any object on Earth.\n\nThis is where things get messed up; as there is no limit to the distance between you and any object in the universe, it's impossible to say what you would see. But what if there was a limit to this distance? What if you were inside a relatively small room without any windows? What would this look like?\n\nIt is possible to come with a few predictions. What would please me the most would be a 3D-simulation of the concept. I haven't been able to find anything about this on the net. I presented the idea to friend and he quickly concluded that it just wouldn't make any sense. But I insist.\n\nAlso, is parallax seen as a property of the universe, or a property of the human eye/mind?\n\nThoughts?\n\nPS: I'm sorry if this is the wrong place to post this, I couldn't find any better place on reddit and I really want to know what there is to know about this subject.\n",

Unfortunately, we weren't taught some essential facts/skills needed to simply live life as an adult in the US. I run across people all the time that either don't know how to do taxes or don't realize that they can voice complaints to their congresspeople, etc.    \n\nI think another issue is that the government has its hands in a lot of things but they don't all seem connected (maybe thats what they want.. idk). I think we would all benefit from a tighter government 'brand' that very clearly communicates it's purpose and how to use it's services... kind of like the first step any company would take. This 'brand' should also include videos/websites/written tutorials to explain things to the people the government is set up to serve in an engaging fashion.    \n\nTutorials might include:    \n\n- how to do taxes  \n- how to send mail  \n- how to vote  \n- how to comment on legislation  \n- what incentives exist to own a home, go to the army, drive an electric car, etc.   \n- where to find more information (legislation, budget, federal programs, etc.)    \n    \n",

Well... what if you could choose your engine sound? For instance, you could go on itunes...

Then upload your tunes to the car and it will blast them as you drive down the street. I can't decide if I think this idea is genius or just plain ridiculous. Thought I'd throw it out there.",

            "selftext": "This is an idea for a sort of accessory to go with Oculus Rift. It is a seat that recreates the sensation of movement.\n\nHumans cannot sense velocity ([shitty source, I know](https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080521174916AAU4WQ6), but it's the best I could find), we only sense accelleration. Therefore, it should be possible to use gravity to simulate the angular acceleration you experience constantly that lets you know that you're driving.\n\nNow, obviously, you could not simulate anything more than 1G of acceleration in any direction, because of the obvious limits of using gravity, but your average fat normal person couldn't likely handle more than 1 or 2Gs anyway before becoming uncomfortable.\n\nBasically, the idea is, lets say you're going to play a racing game, or watch a race. You're on the starting line, you put on your Oculus Rift, and push start on the steering wheel. Ready? Go! You slam the gas and let-up the clutch, and your seat, steering wheel and foot pedals all drop backwards so that you're basically facing the sky. But because your vision and hearing are immersed in the game, you don't feel like you've gone back, you just feel like the acceleration is slamming you backwards in your seat as your car flings forward at 9m/s^2 . The same principal would work for turns. You would also have small pneumatic or hydraulic cylinders (probably pneumatic due to the fact this would require incredibly quick changes) under your seat to simulate bumps in the road.\n\nThe chair would receive the data from a computer, which would receive data about the track or course from a ridiculously accurate accelerometer.\n\nI know that as physics goes, this should work, but my question is, would the human body know that it's being lied to in this case? Also, does anyone have any idea how much it would cost to build? I could build it myself, the question is supplies and cost.\n\nEdit: **TL;DR** using gravity to trick your mind into thinking you're moving.",

By the end of the book, I knew a lot of nadsat words (it isn't really a different language, as it uses mostly English words and structure, it just changes a few words), and some years later I still remember some.\n\nThere is a mini dictionary at the back to look up the words you don't know in, or if you can't work out the words from context. The problem with this would be that it would require a literal dictionary for the language to accompany the book. This is why I have decided that it would work best on some kind of e-reader, which can easily store the dictionary, or if you come across a word that you might normally look, you could just tap or highlight the word, and it could easily display the definition and/or translation (in the language which you already speak).\n\nFinally, at first, I thought that this would be very impractical, as it would require a writer who fluently spoke at least 2 languages, but I have since realised that you only need someone who is fluent in 2 languages to translate parts of the book. \n",

Mostly I feel it's because **a majority of the questions they ask are incredibly obvious and it feels stupid to even bother answering them**. So they'll ask a question like \"If the equation is y=4x+6 then what is the slope?\" and everyone will just sit there thinking \"c'mon, guy, just get on with it. We want to leave.\"\n\nSo anyway, I had an idea to fix this problem. Basically **every student gets like a sign they can hold up when the teacher ask a question**. The sign would be like a notebook on a stick that has **different colored pages depending on the degree to which they know the answer**. It would look similar to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTqaAs86xmU#t=630). The pages would be:\n\n* Dark Green - I know the answer\n* Light Green - I know the answer, but I don't want to answer because I feel the question is really obvious\n* Yellow - I think I know the answer, but I don't want to answer because I'll feel stupid if I'm wrong\n* Red - I don't know the answer\n* Light blue - I'm not paying attention because I feel I know the material already\n* Dark blue - I'm not paying attention, but I probably should be\n\nI feel this would really help because **the teacher would be able to quickly gauge where the class is** based on the number of colors in the class and they'll know to either slow down and explain more or speed up. Also, since all the students have to hold up a sign, the students that aren't paying attention but probably should be will be reminded that they should be paying attention without a teacher having to blatantly point it out.

You walk up, the entire menu and all subs/sides/etc are on the screen.  You choose by category (Chicken/Burger) and then pay into the machine (Card or a cash/bill acceptor like at a Self-Check Out).  You submit the order and it goes to the kitchen.  When the order is ready, the person working the drive through takes the bag over to the machine and right next to it is one of those 1 side opened at a time bank drawers.  They put the bag of food in, slide close and lock their side, and the person on the other end can open the drawer and have their food and be on their way.  \n\nAlso, for downtown establishments that have a homeless problem it might deter some of the more offensive smelling customers from coming inside during the day but still being able to frequent the establishment without being asked to leave or being kicked out. \n\nEdit: The real lightbulb is in the TL;DR\n\nTL;DR A Redbox style kiosk for fast food that you can access on food day or night without setting foot inside the restaurant.

Also, the cold side of Mars drops to around [-153 Celsius](https://www.google.com/search?q=temperature+of+mars&gws_rd=ssl) \n\nHere's what I'm thinking. Lay down a superconducting 'wire' along the equator and run a current through it and we get a magnetic field. The entire line would need to be covered in super cooling refrigerators, but the wire on the dark side of Mars wouldn't need very much cooling. But the highest temperature of Mars being ~20 Celsius we'll need fuckton of liquid nitrogen (~-210 Celsius) or we might be able to use the CO2 already present on mars and get the dry ice down to the necessary temperature.\n\nWe need superconductors because otherwise the wires will have so much resistance we'd need an outrageous amount of power to keep the necessary current flowing.\n\nI haven't done the exact calculations but I reckon to produce a decent magnetic field (~50 microTesla, like on earth) we'd need hundreds of turns of wires running hundreds of amperes in each turn.",

But Venus also doesn't has a [magnetic field](http://image.gsfc.nasa.gov/poetry/venus/V3.html). This could be a problem since it's closer to the Sun but perhaps the thick atmosphere can balance it out.\n\nA day on Venus [is longer](http://www.universetoday.com/47898/length-of-day-on-venus/) than an year. This might have some advantages. We could settle down on the dark side of Venus for a few (earth) months. Being out of the sun side will mean less atmospheric disturbances.\n\nMost of all, Venus is fucking hot. [Mean Temp 462 Celsius](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus). But approximately half a dozen miles in the sky where pressure is similar to earth, it may be a viable settlement option. Being hot, means that we can get all the energy we'll need for hundreds of years (if not thousands) from the planet itself. The thick atmosphere also acts as an energy trap, the ground is pretty much all lava. Approximate example, make a water tube of high melting point metal and simply 'hang' it under your floating city (making a U shape). Throw water down from one end, steam will come up from the other end.\n\nPlus being so close to the Sun might make solar energy another viable option. The acidic atmosphere might be a problem, perhaps a giant floating plastic container could solve that. But keeping the city afloat will probably be the biggest challenge.\n\n",

We could simply hit a button on our computer or laptop to activate eye-tracking and coupled with a relatively simple software, it could be able to guess our approximate location and then position the mouse pointer to the nearest button or link, for example the reasonably-distinct 'submit' button here on reddit. It could also track both our eyes individually so that it only clicks when we blink one eye and not while normal blinking.

This would be primarily for less popular or older artists. \n\nGetting a venue might be difficult, but most universities have space that could be rented for free or very cheap by students. Then people prepay for discounted tickets (additional money earns them merchandise or even backstage passes). \n\nJust like other crowdfunding, if the retainer isn't met, the money is refunded.  If the goal is reached, additional tickets can be sold at the door for a few dollars more than the campaign price.\n\nIt would be a cool way for bands that aren't touring to book a gig and for fans to see bands they really care about.",

Basically, I'm looking to make use of an already existing backbone of energy delivery. This system of course, is a bit dangerous as wind currents may push the aircraft into the towers. \n\nAnother way to do this would be an airship with a flatter set of lighter weight collectors that hang low enough that a side force would not  push the craft or collector into the towers/lines. With a long thin body you could use a larger quantity of power with an equal amount of area exposed to side forces.  This could also allow for slower speeds as aerodynamic lift wouldn't necessary. \n\n\nEdit:\n\nOk so new addition. I've been looking into ground effect vehicles and [ground effect dirigibles](http://theflyingyacht.com/). With the larger length of a blimp you can use ground effect with properly designed wings that would allow you to remain in ground effect up to a few hundred feet high, which is within the standard height range (50-150ft) of an american electrical tower. Ground effect allows you to have a smaller than necessary lifting gas balloons but still get the lift necessary to travel great distances with larger weights. ",

Getting internet the same way you connect to the communication network.\n\nFacebook, twitter, WhatsApp and a dozen others have put a major dent in the telecommunications industry forever. I give it 2 decades before they all go bankrupt and all kinds of communication is done through internet. \n\nWe literally have the technology to do this right now. We can already call through the internet, using apps like Viber, Skype etc. The only reason companies like Vodafone, Verizon are surviving is because they've always 'been here'. I think the existing companies will likely be the biggest speed breaker on the road to all-internet-communications. \n\nPay for only one thing, Internet and you get Music, TV, movies, call/sms (sms can also be replaced completely btw), games, social media, news and about a million other possibilities. \n\nAbout repurposing existing satellites, idk how they work but as long as they're transferring information calls or whatever, it's being done in the form of 1s and 0s. Again, idk the specifics or the efficiency, but I think a software update is all that's needed to make the transition. \n\nCable internet sucks. At some point in the future when we have 100k res 3D holographic movies (?), optical (google) fiber may be the only thing that can keep up. Why deal with wires at all?

You should be able to tell it your proficiency in the language if you click \"Yes\". It would then come up with a dropdown box, asking you how well you know the language, and allow you to pick from a certain amount:\n\n* If you picked \"Fluent\", it would leave you alone. It would be the same as clicking \"Yes\" today.\n\n* If you picked \"Conversational\", It would allow you to pick single words and change the language to your own in browser.\n\n* If you picked \"Learning\", you could click on the first letter of each sentence to define the whole sentence. You could also click on each word. \n\n* If you picked \"Not Familiar\", you would basically be clicking \"No\" as you do today.\n\nAs it is now, Yes and No are basically on opposite ends this scale where it stands.\n\n**TL;DR Make Google Translate behave on web pages in a way that would benefit the language learner by allowing them to translate words and sentences.**",

They can survive in Antarctica, inside freaking volcanos, at the bottom of the ocean, Who's to say they can't survive in the clouds of venus and the polar ice caps of mars..\n\nWe'll need some kind of species that evolve thousands of times faster than humans. One thing all living organisms do is make their surroundings better suited for them. So, perhaps some kinda of algae or plankton might be a better choice than aerobic bacteria since both Venus & Mars have a lot of CO2. If we can get them to start making O2 up there naturally, that'll be a big load off our minds when we do finally get there. Mars only has the CO2 left over from millions of years, I seriously doubt there's any CO2 production going on there (unlike Venus which has volcanoes. So any oxygen we do make will be reduced or burned), so there's a real chance of 'some' terraformation, whatever we can do with 1% atmosphere density. \n\nWe'll also have to provide initial 'fuel' for the microorganism colony to survive for hundreds of thousands of generations, which will be about a few dozen earth years. After that it's really up to evolution and hopefully the ones living on the edges of their colony will venture out and learn to adapt to survive.",

When it's noon, the rocket at that particular position (where sun is at it's highest) will fire up and push the earth away from the sun. Keep it firing about 30 minutes (say 11:45 to 12:15) and then fire the next one (which is placed at a position where the clock says 11:45.\n\nSo, we have a stream of continually firing rockets directly opposite to the line joining the center of earth and sun, hence driving us away and giving us a few more million years before our Red Giant sun collapses into a white dwarf.\n\nAssumptions: We won't blow ourselves up until then, We'll actually still be living on earth in addition to neighboring star's planets and space stations (maybe even galaxies). Remember, we're talking 4 billion years from now, so there' no question of technology or resources. \n\nNow, my solution doesn't take into account the tilt of the earth. The equator is not in line with the Earth-Sun centers line, most of the time because of the tilt. To fix that, we could have giant 'railings' along the longitudes to put our rockets besides them, say about an angular width from -10 degrees to +10 degrees about the equator. Then we can line up our rockets perfectly and fire away.\n\nAlso, as the sun grows up, it's density plunges. That is, the effective gravitational force that makes earth revolve around the center of mass of the system will grow weaker. That is, bigger orbits. So, perhaps we might not need to do anything. The expansion of the sun WILL push (not push, more like re-position over millions of years) all the planets outwards so maybe it will balance out.\n\nWhat could go wrong? What are some other ways we can save earth from diving into the sun?",

            "selftext": "I've been thinking about truth recently.\n\nMore specifically, I was thinking about why some people fiercely disagree with each other when they both probably agree on the same ultimate things. A good portion of this is undoubtedly due to things like ego and morality... but beyond all that many people will disagree from a purely logical point of view.\n\nLet's take that over-done zen-master question \"If a tree falls and nobody is around to hear it, does it make a sound?\"\n\nFor whatever reason in our culture the first and most common response is \"Yes, of course it does! Falling trees are LOUD!\". Usually this response is instinctive first and logic second. Then someone pipes up and disagrees, \"No, it doesn't make a sound!\" and refutes the first person's claim with \"How can sound exist without someone to hear it?\" \n\nThe best common-sense evolution of this debate goes into the finer points over what it takes to make a sound, talking about sound waves, human hearing, or things like that. The worst-case and common-practice is going to be useless name-calling and chest-thumping. Note how we see this debate style in many other places in our lives. Then someone who wants us all to make nice will say that it's both, because this is a grey area.\n\nIf I were to express this with math, I'd say that the value of the tree falling making a sound is either equal to 1 or 0 (true or false). Someone wants to say that it's \"a grey area\" and claim it's a 0.4 on the truth spectrum (which doesn't make sense). Or some will want to say it's both a 0 and a 1, which also doesn't make sense as we know a tree's sound isn't living in a state of quantum super-position (I hope).\n\nSo what went wrong here? Well, we defined exactly what we disagree about but it was ignored. Rather than discuss \"what does this question mean?\" We talked about what each of us wanted it to mean and talked about the topic as if each side was disagreeing with us.\n\nMore or less, when I say truth is a parabolic I'm claiming that truth is both black-and-white as well as a spectrum.\n\nFor those of you who recall what a parabola looks like, think of the X and Y values of it. For any Y value there exists two solutions at all times. Only at Y=0 for y=x^2 does one and only one answer exist. A paraboloid is a 3d version of this ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraboloid#mediaviewer/File:Paraboloid_of_Revolution.svg )\n\nThe Y axis is the ambiguity in what's being asked. If you were to ask someone for their name and they answered \"Taylor\", there may have been other answers they could truthfully provide, meaning that Y is not equal to 0, and thus multiple roots exist. Likewise, asking for someone's full name is less ambiguous and closer to Y=0.\n\nQuestions about the sounds of falling trees are more ambiguous over what exactly is meant, because there can be many interpretations of the question. \"Is sound the range of compressed pressure waves human ears tend to react to?\" \"Is it sound when a human hears it?\" \"Is my internal monologue a sound?\" etc... For these Y > 0 questions we have two roots where the answers can grow further and further apart. Sometimes questions are not \"yes\" or \"no\", which is why we can think about a paraobolid (3d) which gives us a large range of answers (technically infinite, which is where this specific shape may break down my metaphor for truth).\n\nSo there is is. The y-plane intersects z-and-x axis with truths and the distance from 0 is the ambiguity of the discussion.\n\nI propose discussions focus on resolving ambiguity as it is readily more useful in every day life (one answer to a specific thing) than spending decades debating things like what to do about legalizing drugs (wishy-washy arguments and grunting through people who disagree).\n\nResolving the ambiguity to a point where most answers are basically the same thing that everyone can agree is more useful than saying \"well sometimes a tree makes a sound\".\n\nAnd thus, truth has a shape.",

I currently work at a dog-daycare place, so I've seen a fair share of dogs who are actually good at \"play-wrestling.\" So what if we made it an actual sport? Obviously it would be nothing at all like notorious cock-fighting and dogfights to the death that are meant to make people money. To make sure of this, there would be referees in the ring with the dogs, holding spray bottles (full of water), protective gear, and other necessary means to stop the match if it gets too rough or to stop it from escalating from innocent play to an actual scuffle. There would be weight/size divisions (similar to MMA/UFC), and there would be three judges to decide which dog seemed to wrestle better. \nI think it would not only be an adorable thing, but it could also turn out to be an amazing display of acrobatics and skill. Any comments as to how this could or couldn't work or other suggestions/anything I forgot to take into consideration would be appreciated.",

            "selftext": "This would be for people that live in places with small kitchens where you couldn't have a dishwasher and have limited counter-space. \n\nMount a set of arms that are on rails attached to the underside of your kitchen cabinets. This would allow the arms to slide over and wash the dishes in the sink and then put them in the dish rack for drying. Once dry they could then put the dishes in the cabinet and utensils in the drawers. With proper image recognition sensors it might also be able to pick up things like spices and put them into their place as well.\n\nThe key is that the arms are no more than 1 meter long and fold flatly to about 5cm thickness under the cabinet. I think that using multiple suction points instead of pincers would be much more effective in picking up different shapes and sizes of dishes. Except for utensils.\n\nEdit: Thinking more about this you could use a three point suction system to pick up dishes, and with a single smaller suction to pick up some flatware though it would need to be wide enough (+1cm). \n\nThe cleaning system would be based around the steam cleaning devices that are sold as mops and whatnot.\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Astar-Steam-Cleaner-Steamer-Shipping/dp/B00C6SMBGK\n\nSo It would drop an arm down into the sink, when it makes contact it suctions onto a dish, then the second arm sprays the steam.  The first arm would then release a suction point so the steam could clean underneath it, thereby always having 2 points of connection to the dishes.  The steam cleaning would also mean that it wouldn't require large amounts of water or a scrubber to get the dishes clean. You could also have an attachment so that the steam arm could sterilize the counter tops with a spray and attached wiper/squeegee. \n\nEdit 2:  It will now have a roll down screen that extends outward and blocks overspray of the steam, as well as ensures that all particles drop into the sink.

            "selftext": "Background: I'm a writer developing a story about a secret society of wizards who channel \"ley-lines\" of magic via symbols tattooed on their persons in order to cast spells. The relevant thing here is all the action takes place at nighttime, and during the story development, while writing the mythos/lore, it occured to me that the nights should have names, and that the names should only be known by this underground/ hidden society. So I looked up the etymology of the day names - Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday etc... and came up with seven appropriate night names that I'll be using for the story. Anyway I figured this was too good to keep to myself, in world where a large portion of the population stays up late. I doubt it will become custom or anything, as much as it makes sense to me theoretically, it may not be practical- but I thought some of my fellow night owls would have fun with it, as I hope future readers might. I'll post my story development notes below:\n\nMonday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday,   Friday,      Saturday,      Sunday\n\nGanight, Marsnight, Mercsnight, Thorsnight, Vennight, Hadsnight, Moonnight\n\n\n\nHOW IT WORKS: The way this works is, the days are separated by the sunrise and sunset rather than 12 am (which is really an arbitrary hour in between.) This means that the start of the night and day change throughout the year, but guess what, that\u2019s how it works in nature! \n\nAlso, Moonight, popularly known as Sunday night, comes before Monday because Sunday night really is the first weeknight for most people, and to underline the idea, Friday night is the first \u201cweekend\u201d night, so it not only provides a balance to SUNday e.g. MOONnight, it also heralds the start of the work week, nicely fitting both purposes. \n\nRemember, in this setup the nights are their own separate units of time, Moonnight doesn\u2019t belong to either day, it\u2019s the night between the two days. I put them together in the etymology so that it\u2019s easier to follow along.\n\n\n\n\nEtymology:\n\n\nMonday: The English noun Monday derived sometime before 1200 from moned\u00e6i, which itself developed from Old English (around 1000) m\u014dnand\u00e6g and m\u014dnd\u00e6g (literally meaning \"moon's day\")\n\nGanight (G-awe-night): In Greek mythology, Gaia was the personification of the Earth. This is the first night after the first traditional workday, where it\u2019s wise to consider practical matters for which we need to stay grounded.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t* * *\n\n\nTuesday: The name Tuesday derives from the Old English \"Tiwesd\u00e6g\" and literally means \"Tiw's Day\".[1] Tiw is the Old English form of the Proto-Germanic god *T\u00eewaz, or T\u00fdr in Norse, a god of war and law\n\nMarsnight: Belonging to the god \u201cMars\u201d i.e. Aries, god of war.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t* * *\n\n\nWednesday: The name is a calque of the Latin dies Mercurii \"day of Mercury\", reflecting the fact that the Germanic god Woden (Wodanaz or Odin) during the Roman era was interpreted as \"Germanic Mercury\".\n\nMercsnight: Mercury i.e. Hermes is not only a messenger, but is a god of transitions and boundaries, so it\u2019s not surprising that his night falls in the center of the week, embodying the transition between  the beginning of the week to the end.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t* * *\n\n\n\nThursday: The contemporary name comes from the Old English \u00deunresd\u00e6g, \"Thunor's Day\"[1][2][3] (with loss of -n-, first in northern dialects, from influence of Old Norse \u00deorsdagr, meaning \"Thor's Day\"). Thunor, Donar (German, Donnerstag) and Thor are derived from the Proto-Germanic god Thunraz, god of thunder.\n\nThorsnight: Thor, god of thunder, whose divinity knows no barrier between light and dark- his hammer falling at all hours of day or night, claims right to the night following his day. (mostly because he\u2019s a badass).\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t* * *\n\n\n\nFriday: The name Friday comes from the Old English Fr\u012b\u0121ed\u00e6\u0121, meaning the \"day of Frigg\", a result of an old convention associating the Old English goddess Frigg with the Roman goddess Venus\n\nVennight: Not to be outdone by Thor, Venus, goddess of love, claimed the night following her day- After all, Vennight is the most popular date night of the entire week.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t* * *\n\n\nSaturday: Romans named Saturday dies Saturni (\"Saturn's Day\") no later than the 2nd century for the planet Saturn, which controlled the first hour of that day.\n\nHadsnight: i.e. \u201cHades\u201d night, belonging to the god of the underworld. Who could argue that Hadsnight isn\u2019t the time of mischief?  Hadsnight is the dark heart of the weekend.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t* * *\n\nSunday: Sunday, being the day of the Sun, as the name of the first day of the week, is derived from Egyptian astrology.\n\n\nMoonnight: Moonight, being the night of the Moon, as the name of the first night of the week.",

            "selftext": "I could see this idea being implemented through a lump sum due in a certain amount of years or as a deduction from a graduate's paychecks, a sort of \"tax\".\n\nPlease hear me out and read the whole post before dismissing this off-hand!  At first it sounds like the idea of some entitled millennial, but I sincerely believe there could be multiple benefits to this idea:\n\n**It will bring academic rigor back to colleges.**  At numerous schools across the country, the amount of students \"earning\" high academic marks has been increasing for decades.  This is known as \"grade inflation.\"  The average GPA in US schools [has made a staggering climb from 2.3 to 3.1 from 1920 to 2006](http://www.gradeinflation.com/).  At the University of Florida, [51 percent of all grades were A's or A-'s in 2013](http://www.gainesville.com/article/20140720/COLUMNISTS/140719661?p=1&tc=pg).  Ivy League schools do not seem to have escaped grade inflation: the median grade for undergrads at Harvard is an A-.  The amount of students with a C or less [has dropped from 25 percent to 5 percent from 1969 to 2013](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/wp/2013/12/20/why-grade-inflation-even-at-harvard-is-a-big-problem/).\n\nCould this mean students are studying more?  No.  According to numerous surveys over 42 years, weekly study times [have declined from 27 to 14 hours a week, between 1961 and 2003](http://www.aei.org/files/2010/08/05/07-EduO-Aug-2010-g-new.pdf).  That is less than two hours a night if you're counting.  Despite this, grades increase.  Clearly, academic standards have dropped.  Whether they admit it or not, colleges are businesses.  If they want to keep more tuition dollars rolling in, they can't have students washing out from poor grades.  To keep collecting fat federal loan checks they need to dumb down the courses.\n\nIn fact, when I was in college, I had professors admit to me that they have dropped the difficulty of their courses over the time they had been there.  If a course was even remotely challenging, they would incur the wrath of angry students leaving bad course evaluations.  The parents who complain to the teachers when one of their precious little angels brings home a bad report card have instilled the idea that you *deserve* a good grade in these students.  I realize that's only anecdotal but it illustrates my point.\n\nIf colleges only got paid if their graduates were competitive in the job market, they would have to ensure that only students who are willing to work hard and have natural aptitude for their chosen discipline get through the filter.  It would mean large amounts of students washing out or getting rejected, but such is life (I don't think that's an entitled thing to say).  There is a reason college enrollment used to be a fraction of what it is today.\n\nI know that was long, but the other benefits will flow from that one.\n\n**It will knock tuition back down.**  College costs have skyrocketed at [four times the rate of consumer inflation](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-08-15/cost-of-college-degree-in-u-s-soars-12-fold-chart-of-the-day.html).  The increased demand for degrees forces tuition up.  As long as Uncle keeps churning out easy-to-get, everyone-goes-to-college loans, tuition will climb higher and higher.  Again, colleges don't like to say they're businesses, but they definitely act like them.  Why are Ferraris expensive?  Everyone wants them but there are few of them around.  Everyone wants a college degree, everyone is able to pay for them thanks to Uncle, so colleges see no reason to drop tuition (\"everyone\" being an obvious hyperbole).  If only students with aptitude and a will to work (that is, students who are intelligent and don't screw off beer bonging every weekend) can make it through, the application process will get much more stringent and fewer students will go.  Less demand means prices drop.  There is a reason tuition was once 1000 percent cheaper than it is today.  It is no coincidence that when college was harder tuition was a lot more affordable.\n\n**It will drive professional salaries back up.**  The oversupply of college graduates is driving their wages down in the same way it drives tuition up.  Since college graduates are now numerous, they're almost worthless, [as a ten-year decline in the wages of college graduates has shown](http://www.epi.org/publication/10-year-decline-wages-college-graduates/).  What makes a Ferrari expensive?  It is composed of more rare high quality parts that make its performance nearly unmatched.  How do we make it so college graduates are more \"expensive\"?  Make them rare and unmatched.\n\n**It could potentially bring about a change in our entire educational culture.**  Our public educational system of everyone-gets-a-trophy is arguably what has led to the decline in higher education academic standards.  It would now be the duty of public education to make students competitive in the workforce or in college admissions.  In the same way declining public education has dumbed down college, \"smarting up\" college could \"smart up\" public education.  If nothing else high school graduates would be much more educated and competitive in jobs that do not require a college degree.  Who knows?\n\nAnd the most obvious benefit...\n\n**College graduates would have a much easier time finding work in their fields.**  Not only would this policy spur colleges to become more rigorous, it would give them incentive to be more aggressive in helping their students find jobs.  It would be in their best interests to teach their students job-hunting skills, help them network, and help them find internships--provided they keep up and work at it.\n\nThe Missouri School of Science and Technology, formerly University of Missouri--Rolla, has a reputation as one of the best engineering schools in the nation.  [It offers a $12,000 scholarship to students who score over 30 on the ACT (1410 SAT, 95th percentile) and rank in the top 10% of their high school class](http://sfa.mst.edu/scholarshipsgrants/scholarships-grants/index.html).  Why do these students get such a tuition discount?  They are actually competitive with their skills and are likely to do well as engineers in the future, which means they will be able to afford to donate to the school after they graduate.  But let's humor the school and say it's because they're likely to do things to better mankind and that Missouri S&T just wants to help them with it.  IF that's the case, then they are basically saying that they don't expect less competitive students to do well in the job market (DUH) and thus won't contribute as much to engineering.  But if that's the case, why are they gouging them with full tuition if the education they're selling won't benefit them?  I know, buyer beware, but that still raises some serious ethical concerns.  The other possibility is that they expect the brighter students to be better donors since they'll make more money and that they better gouge the dumb ones now because they will not be successful enough to donate.  Either way, they're not very concerned about the professional development of their students and just want their tuition money.\n\nI INCLUDE MYSELF AS ONE OF THE DUMB GRADUATES WHO SHOULD NEVER HAVE SET FOOT ON A COLLEGE CAMPUS, so please don't think I'm on some kind of high horse here!\n\nI'm sure there's many holes in this idea and things I've left unmentioned.  I look forward to your challenges or suggestions.  I'm sure there are many typos, even though I have proofread this a few times.\n\n**TL;DR:**  Colleges only get their money if their graduates find work related to their studies.  This forces colleges to make their graduates more competitive, admit students who are talented and willing to work, and could drive tuition down.",

Rather than sending people over to build and teach, just have them do it in these new cities. Additionally, until the cities are well-established, the military could be used to police them, preventing any seriously dangerous elements screening missed (for people associated with/working with warlords) from causing the issues there to crop up here. Finally, by shrinking the populations of these nations, outsourcing would also take a serious blow, because all those workforces would now be on American soil, and thus, under American law.

However, an unelected world government would end badly if the government was made up of anything like our current governments.\n\nFor this to work, the world government would need to be highly advanced artificial intelligence. These machines would be programmed to see all humans as equal. Pretty much, the UN Declaration of Human Rights, with some modifications to ensure that it considered all groups equal. Namely, adding \"sexual orientation\" and \"gender identity\" to protected groups. These machines would have command over a large military in order to enforce these laws. While some nations would, of course, need dramatic upheaval, others would just need small adjustments (like the United States).\n\nThe purpose of this would be to take non-logical mindsets out of government. The machine government would pretty much be there to go \"Yeah, no, that's not cool\" when governments try to do things that are discriminatory or just evil. For example, the world government would require all places to treat all humans as equals, and thus, outlaw things like homophobic and transphobic laws, as well as sexist laws (in both directions).\n\nBasically, this wouldn't be a \"government\" as we think of it, but more something that can actually overrule nations, like a UN that actually matters. As humans are too flawed and biased to do it, only machines would be able to do it.\n\nhttp://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/\n\nUN Declaration of Human Rights.",

I've watched some football, know how its played, and know the rules, but don't watch it enough to know the big name players or top teams. So, I thought of a website that would give you a brief (30 seconds to a minute) run down of a topic's current, noteworthy events to at least get a conversation started and be armed with a few talking points.\n\nI know that execution could be tricky as one could do a quick google or wiki search, but how does the basic idea sound?",

I mean I don't do it purely on looks, if I find someone that is only average I go into their profile and look at their pictures and info, but if someone is attractive then I instantly like their account. \n\nI think if there was an app that showed a quick list of personality traits and interests about the person and then when you both matched showed you their pictures, I think the dating aspect would work out better. \n\nOf course this is broken by the fact that most boys my age on Tinder are only interested in getting some nudes.",

            "selftext": "So Fox has those shows like Big Brother, Amazing Race, and Survivor where a group of good looking adults are enclosed in a location and vote eachother out and stab eachother in the back. \n\nMy idea for a show is called Brain vs. brawn. Eight teams of two (so 16 people for the non-math savvy) are put together to try and win 2 million dollars (one mil for each member of the team). Now each team has one \"jock\" and one \"nerd.\" There are two challenges each week, one \"brain\" challenge and one \"brawn\" challenge. The twist is that the \"nerd\" does the brawn challenge and the \"jock\" does the brawn challenge. \n\nThey know next week's challenges, and have all week to prepare for the challenges. The team members will have to train eachother in with their knowledge to get the other person through their challenge. \n\nSo say the jock's challenge is build a computer, the nerd has a week to teach him how to do it. The nerds challenge is to do an obstacle course, the jock will have to weight train him, get him running, etc.\n\nI think it's be funny to watch a jock recite Shakespeare and a nerd wrestle another nerd",

It pops up like one of those [popup tents](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9q0_ukhiYA#t=44), with a screen (11\"-17\") depending on which is connected. The projector basically aims almost straight up and adjusts the image to appear normal.\n\nThe keyboard is a [projection keyboard](http://www.amazon.com/Celluon-Magic-Laser-Projection-Keyboard/dp/B005ES6E6W) for use on a normal desk/flat surface. Another option is for when you are typing on your lap and away from a solid desk, is to have a bluetooth connection to a pair of glasses that displays the keyboard. It would appear like the keyboard is floating in air but the base computer would pick up where your fingers are. This would be bad for touch typers but usable overall.\n\nThe idea is to minimize the construction/raw materials needed to produce a netbook-sized processor computer that can run without a cooling fan. It would be about 3\"W x 4\"L x 2\"D (cm 7.6 Wide x 10.15 Long  x 5 Deep).\n\nedit: I did come up with a better way of getting the floating keyboard in the glasses. Use a small projector that aims upwards towards a pair of glasses, this way when you look down at the device an image of a keyboard will be formed on your glasses when you are at the proper angle. ",

The most famous instance that brought this law to light is the [Ellen DeGeneres/Bradley Cooper selfie](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2572822/Bradley-Cooper-owns-right-famous-selfie-history-took-photo.html) at the Oscars earlier this year. My idea would make a standard camera app that has a terms of use agreement which says that the photographer surrenders any copyright claim to the owner of the camera. Additionally, the terms of use would state that using the app at all means that you have read and agree to the terms of use. (You don't need the user to click \"I agree\" or even show it to the them at all.) This second clause is standard procedure for everything digital in the US, from smartphone apps to websites. It could also, if necessary, add a tag in the EXIF data to prove that the photo was taken with this app. (This may not be necessary though.) The end result would be that you can install this app to your phone, hand the phone to some one else and have them take a picture while still retaining the legal rights to that photo. All you would really need to do is add one sentence to the existing terms of use agreement.\n\nAlso, if the developer of this app wants to be really creepy, they could instead designate the copyright to be transferred to them, or any third party, and no one would realize at all since no one reads those stupid agreements anyway.\n\nTLDR: Blanket TOU agreements suck, especially if no one reads them.\n\nEdit: To clarify what I meant by \"you don't need to show the TOU to them at all,\" you do need to have it accessible to the user if they want to read it, however you don't need to overtly present it and have them click \"I agree\" (or even mention it in fine print on an overt screen from within the app) in order for it to be legally binding. The general consensus of major app devs seems to be to have one link at the bottom of the Play Store description and one link somewhere in the app settings.",

So would it be possible to build a tire that changes its diameter based on the input it senses from the driver?\n\nFor safety sake, the \"default\" mode would have to be \"high rolling resistance\" but if it senses you're cruising, it could reduce the contact patch with the road to give you better gas mileage.\n",

            "selftext": "I've had this idea for a few years now, but I don't have the knowledge to create it on my own. It'd be awesome to see this realized some day.\n\n\nThis idea is all about convenience. People have less and less time these days to plan, let alone shop for meals. Imagine a system that would allow people to scan the QR code at the bottom their grocery receipt that stores the quantity and type of food products purchased and separate those items from non-food items. Now imagine that smartphone application connects to a personalized account they can access from a PC. No longer would people need to look through their entire kitchen to make a list of what groceries they do or do not need. It would all be available at their fingertips.\n\nHow would it work? Once someone scans the QR code on (or manually enters) their grocery receipt, a database would create an inventory of each item purchased and allow them to select from hundreds of thousands of recipes based on those items and each ingredient used would subtract that quantity from their inventory, sending them notifications if they run out of or are low on any ingredient. If they end up using more of an item than a recipe calls for, they can modify the amount of each item used to get a more accurate representation of the quantity actually used.\n\nIt could even be made so the database would show recipes that are missing one or two key ingredients to alert someone to food they might want to purchase the next time they go grocery shopping. Nutritional information would also be available for each recipe to calculate as a whole or by serving size to help people live a healthier lifestyle. It could tie in coupons to the mix so when they are shopping for an item, it shows any available coupons for those items, making shopping more cost efficient.\n\nThis of course would be based on the ability to partner with various grocers to access the inventory of items via a QR code. However, if this is not available at the start, I'm sure it could still be done to some extent by instead taking a snapshot of the list of items on their receipt. This would likely be less effective and more time consuming, but would not require partnerships with grocers. And who knows, maybe in the future everyone will have smart packaging to help keep track of the quantity of each item in their kitchen, making it even easier to use this system.\n\nThe application would allow someone to customize their cart so next time they go shopping, they have a convenient list which cuts the shopping time down significantly. Couple that with another clever idea: Smart Carts - A special shopping cart designed to connect wirelessly to their smartphone, enabling them to be directed to the aisles based on each item in their list in the most efficient way possible. A smart cart could also take product weight into account (as well as other factors such as nutritional info. or store-wide sales), so when they go to check out, no longer would they need to put every item on a conveyer belt to be scanned by a cashier. It would take the cumulative weight of the items and compare them to the individual items in their list and have their total cost waiting for them when they arrive.\n\nIn summary, these ideas would make grocery shopping easier, cheaper and faster, allowing people to have time for more important things in life. They would keep track of everything from the fridge to the pantry, making it easier to cut down on wasteful spending on items that might have been overlooked when making a normal grocery list. Tie this in with a dynamic recipe database to allow for quicker, healthier meals to be made and less time spent hunting for ingredients.\n\nThank you to all who read my idea and I appreciate any comments and ideas of your own.",

I've had a startup idea and I'd like you to deconstruct it, ask questions, tell me it's awful (if it is) and pose new solutions that would be better to my own.\n\n**Without further ado, here's the problem I'm solving:**\n\nAchieving online sales of a product (tangible or non-tangible) can be costly (marketing/time spend before achieving first sales) and difficult for the first-time (and experienced) seller, especially when bringing a new product to market. This problem is exacerbated for individuals with limited technical knowledge.\n\n**Solution:**\n\nMinimalist product pages (not stores) that are promoted by an army of affiliates for a % of each sale -- you have your own sales team/products promoted for you -- we check each product page for quality to ensure that our offerings are top-notch, so that there aren't many low-quality product pages that aren't being promoted by affiliates.\n\nEssentially, our website is the online store and the product pages are the individual products.\n\nWe'd be free to use for the basic package, and then charge a monthly fee for premium packages (more product pages, more customisation etc.)\n\nFor our development roadmap, we could add stores (product pages can be added together to make a store), theme customisation, adding other user's products to your own online store to earn a commission on those product sales.\n\nI'm a UX/UI designer so a beautiful, minimalist product is a must.\n\nI'm still planning out the nitty gritty as I only had this idea yesterday evening.\n\nThanks for reading!",

            "selftext": "Dear Facebook,\n\tI think we need to sit down and have a little chat.  Don't worry, it's nothing bad; I just have a proposition for you.\n\tYou see, dear Facebook, I've been noticing something troubling lately. I mean, I've been very proud of you (more than 1.3 BILLION active users?  Wow!) but I can't help noticing that there is one demographic in which you are consistently losing users.  I'm not talking just \"Oh, I'm going to take a break from Facebook, but then realize that nobody knows how to contact me anymore so I guess I'll join up again\" losses.  I'm talking honest-to-goodness permanent departures from the site, never to log in again.  I can't help but think that even as your dominance in the market increases, you'll continue to see these losses if things continue as they have, and that saddens me more than you know, dear Facebook, and I can't help but wonder if there's something you could be doing better to prevent this occurrence.\n\tThis group you currently fail to serve - whose membership and associated ad revenue is forever lost to you - are the thousands of people who commit suicide every year.  As we all should know, suicide is a preventable cause of death, and so by not doing anything to prevent said tragedy, you deny yourself the opportunity to profit off of their survival.  I expect better of you.\n\tAfter all, the WHO estimates nearly one million people die from suicide annually (http://www.who.int/mental_health/prevention/en/).  In 2010, more people died from suicide than from motor vehicle crashes (http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/03/health/suicide-rate-rises-sharply-in-us.html?_r=1&).  \n\tI submit to you, Facebook, that this very permanent loss of users is preventable.  You have unprecedented access to equally unprecedented volumes of user data.  You know where these people are, what they like to do, what they've eaten, what they say and to whom they say it.  I'm also aware that you aren't shy about human social engineering and psychological experimentation.  Why not combine these two talents to protect your own profit margins?\n\tI'm certain you're familiar with the infamous case of Target's machine learning algorithm identifying a pregnant teen before her own father (http://techland.time.com/2012/02/17/how-target-knew-a-high-school-girl-was-pregnant-before-her-parents/).  Surely if Target can identify a pregnant teenager, you can identify an individual experiencing depression and/or suicidal thoughts.  It is in your best interests to make sure that that person does not act on those thoughts, thus depriving you of a lifetime of usership (and potential future offspring userships in the years to come).  \n\tAdditionally, I'm sure that you have the abilities to act on these interests. You've come under fire recently after manipulating people's emotions.  You could utilize what you've learned from these \"unethical\" studies to prevent future loss of capital by offering a positive bump to the moods of your most at risk users. You could also identify the loneliest of users and make sure that their posts were seen by someone likely to read and respond.  At a certain threshold, you could even periodically display a link to a suicide hotline - perhaps losing a single ad space with the promise of potentially thousands more that would never be utilized after the unfortunate user otherwise would have quit the site (I'd suggest collecting some cash from whatever non-profit decided to take advantage of your services as well, though that of course would depend on them having any to offer).\n\tAdditionally, such a move has more to gain you than simply buffering your user total against unnecessary decreases: the potential reputational pay-off could be substantial.  I hate to say it, Facebook, but you come off as a bit of a creeper sometimes.  Reminding the masses that you are acting in their best interests can only serve to make them more comfortable with you having access to all of their private information.\n\tAnyway, Facebook, this has been a pleasant exchange, and I hope that you'll take my two cents to heart. I'd hate to see you lose any more progress in this way.\nWarm regards,\n\tDavid",

            "selftext": "As far as I know, unexpected empty seats are an issue for airlines.  A derivatives market for seat futures could help mitigate their risk.\n\nBasically you could short a seat, allowing you to buy it (but not use it) at some market-determined price.  If the seat ends up getting filled, you realize the difference between what the consumer paid and your option price.  If it doesn't get filled, you pay for an empty seat.\n\nObviously, it would have to be structured in such a way that the risk-reward makes sense... maybe option price is significantly below retail price for seat (like .25), but you only get to realize .3 of the difference.  If the airline \"wins\" the bet, they're getting > $0 for the seat, so it seems like there's probably some balance that would work for both parties.  (Also something that could be worked out by market forces.)\n\nThis would also have the benefit of applying a lot of additional brainpower to predicting actual flight occupancies, which would ultimately improve airlines models and help root out inefficiencies in the system.\n\nBiggest insurmountable problem I see right of the bat would be preventing insider trading.  Devising a product that's attractive to both investors and airlines would probably be another challenge.  The question is whether there's a point where the  cost of risk management for airlines balances with investors' desired roi.",

There are some apps out there that simply provide access to specific laws and limited case law, and there are billable hour apps to help manage your time, but I am looking to develop something that is helpful, easy to use, and that makes people think \"how did I get along without this?\"  \n\nI understand that a lot of successful ideas simply improve on things that already exist, and I am completely open to that.  However, it is also helpful when your idea can fill a market gap, and it is even better when you can fill a market gap by showing people one exists where there was previously no perceived deficit. \n\nWhat I would like to develop is a sort of \"law practice on the go\" that allows you to enter client information, relevant research, contact information for opposing counsel, the local rules of court for the specific venue, and save it as a file within the app with the client name.  It would also be helpful if the app automatically tracked the amount of time you were actively using a particular file so that it could calculate your billables automatically.  \n\nObviously, because client information is extraordinarily sensitive, security would exceedingly important.\n\nI have no technical background, so I am looking for feedback in a couple of forms.\n\nFirst, I am looking for other attorneys to tell me whether they think an app like this would be helpful, where they would improve on this idea, and if they have any other input.\n\nSecond, I am looking for information on what goes into developing an app like this (i.e. costs for development). \n\nThird, I would like to hear from non-lawyers about whether they would want an attorney that had access to an app like this for purposes of staying organized and properly calculating the time you are billed for.\n\nI welcome any and all comments.",

That way, you'd never have to worry about data corruption again, nor having to find the safely-remove option in the PC settings. All you would need to do is press the button while you remove the cable (or press it 1-2 seconds before pulling) and it guarantees a safe removal every time.\n\nIs something like this possible?

            "selftext": "This is just a very complicated timepiece. \n\nIt is a mixed app that interacts with a case that mounts on the Pebble watch or something similar. The case clips on and has a clear slightly curved surface that is mounted to the face of the watch so it looks like a slight bubble. The app uses your phone's GPS to center an image of the Earth's surface on the watch, but scaled out to give a larger image that covers hundreds/thousands of miles across. This is centered on your location or to any point on Earth. The case has a tiny LED light that transmits a yellowish light on the surface of the bubble to tell you where the sun is during the day, this changes it's track above the horizon depending on the time of year. At night it switches to a whiter light that tracks the moon across your bubble. The bubble is to ensure a 3 dimensional depth of view. If you look horizontally at your watch you can see the sun/moon above the surface. The screen of the watch may also change it's appearance depending on day or night and show either a daytime sat image of the surface or a nighttime image that shows the lights of the cities from sat views. This isn't real time, though it maybe possible in the future with more sats. These images can be collected from google or whomever is your map software. \n\nThis app would only update your location through a forced send rather than automatically in order to save battery power. It would also go dark unless you hit a button to save on power. For the actual time, an LED in the case would project it on the North side of the bubble out of the way of the sun. \n\nThis idea was inspired by the Orbital Bracelet from the book, \"Player of Games\".",

The way this would work is by simply substituting selected english words with their spanish synonyms.  Every week or so, your browser would add a new set of words, and give you an easily accessible dictionary of them so you can find their meanings when context doesn't allow you to learn their meanings.  \n\nIt would start off easy, and gradually more and more words would be replaced with spanish.  After a while, you could approach it from the other end, and start reading spanish with most of the words replaced with english, and then fewer english words, and so on until you can read entirely in spanish.\n\nGrammar would be tricky, but I think for basic vocabulary something like this would be really helpful.",

It will be the only option for a machine making it \"nothing\" and unhumanlike. \n\nOnly by adding egoism-altruism combo to AI we can emulate human-like emotions to create fully human-like AI.\n\n\n\nNOW IMAGINE:\n\n1) You create neural framework inside a supercomputer server\n\n2) You create a robot with sensory inputs similar to human\n\n3) You create basic machine learning algorithm\n\n4) You create reward-punishment sector and mirror neurons sector\n\n5) You link a robot with server through wifi or any other chordless way (assuming processing power won't fit inside robot\n\n6) You boot up the robot and grow like you would do with a child\n\n\nNote: All information the robot can take is through sensory inputs (equivalents of Eyes, Ears, Touch etc)\n\nYou should end up with robotic version of human.\n\n\n\nWhat do you think?",

I can remember during the Trayvon Martin case not hearing updates for months before the trial. It would be great to have a site dedicated to not giving up on updating news about these types of cases. A more recent example is Keith Vidal - this morning I was searching and the most recent news I could find about this case was from May. \n\n\nThis could even be a user generated content kind of site, as long as it's well moderated. A wikia or a subreddit would work well. Threads could be made such that the OP is continually updated, and the comments are for others to post things they find that are relevant if an update hasn't happened for a week or so. This way, people could help each other stay well informed about these cases. ",

            "selftext": "A bit of backstory:\n\nMy girlfriend's mom downloads a lot of sketchy software onto their laptop, and by extension, a lot of viruses. My girlfriend was out buying a new laptop for school and called me when the people a Best Buy wanted her to pay extra for an anti-virus, and she was scared to refuse. I haven't had an anti-virus in YEARS and I've never gotten a virus. Sometimes I run a scan using Microsoft Security Essentials, but other than that I just avoid going on sketchy sites and always download trusted torrents. I'm pretty sure most of my firewall is even off and so is Real-Time Protection. \n\nHere's is where I think the problem lies: \n\nA lot of people have a very unrealistic image of the web. I know my mom is particularly guilty of it because of how she thought my games caused us to get a virus when I was younger after she went on less-than-reputable sites. I'm sure some of your parents are this way as well. They think that anything can be harmful to your computer, or they think that nothing can be harmful to your computer.\n\nSo how do we fix that? Make some sort of guideline for common-sense safety. Start off with basic principles (e.g. \"the web isn't always bad for your computer, but can be if you don't use discretion when visiting certain websites\") and feed into more complex stuff like how to tell a trusted torrent from a virus, and how to tell reputable software from adware/spamware.\n\nThen turn the outline into a book, or an educational video, or a course that people can take somewhere (either online or in person).

Bike thefts would basically become impossible if people had this habit, which could be encouraged by a national ad campaign.\n\nOne downside is if bikes didn't have serial numbers from being removed by \"someone\". The solution could be a law requiring it, seeing how bike thefts are pretty rampant all over the world.\n\nI see so many bikes being locked up around town where I automatically go \"I bet that's stolen\", but just shrug it off.\n\nEdit: Denmark apparently has a system in use since... last month? http://secondhandbikes.dk/en/how-to-check-if-the-bicycle-you-are-buying-is-reported-stolen/",

            "selftext": "This would all be for worthless Internet points (*different* worthless Internet points), and mostly for fun. But it also might be a good platform for research and learning about trading, especially if it was augmented with detailed statistics tracking.\n\nBasically, the metagame's currency is OPCoin, but you start with a fixed amount and your net-worth in the game doesn't affect your actual reddit karma. Instead, your link and comment karma on reddit affect the price of your shares on KarmaTrader. Link and comment shares would be traded on separate markets.\n\nIf your link or comment karma is over a certain threshold, you can release shares of your own karma to sell to other players. As your reddit karma grows, so does the value of your shares. You can then use your OPCoin to buy shares of other redditors from them or people selling them. The estimated price of a share is based on the number of shares in play (not owned by players) and the amount of karma you have (updated daily), though shares can be sold for any price. \n\nLoss of karma will devalue your shares, as will releasing excess amounts of them. Gains in karma will make your shares more valuable, as will buying back your own shares you released, though at your own expense.\n\nAs a consequence of this, different redditors will offer different risk factors. To keep the game fair, redditors with wildly fast karma growth might be limited or not allowed to play, so the \"little guys\" can have their chance to shine. People with -100 karma probably won't be able to play, as their shares will be effectively worthless.\n\nIt'd be a separate website, by the way. Suggestions for a better currency name are welcome.\n\nI might even implement short-sale, so you can get in on a downvote streak to make a quick buck off a troll. I don't think I'll involve gilding, as that can be directly affected by real money. The finnicky nature of redditors should ensure that the game is unpredictable enough to be fun, but with a more solid and tangible source for the numbers in contrast to completely random generation.\n\nObviously, vote brigading to artificially inflate or deflate share values will not be tolerated. Convicted players will be banned and additonally reported to the reddit admins. Share owners of banned players will automatically have their shares bought back by the system for the lowest all-time price. Not sure what to do with shares the banned player owned. Your KarmaTrader account is linked to your reddit account, so if you're banned on reddit, you're banned on KarmaTrader.\n\nIf people are actually interested in this and it hasn't been done already I'd totally make this happen. It'd probably run on donations/advertising revenue, but probably user-funded advertising like reddit has. Also, open-source.\n\n",

They come in handy to each person, to remind them of a point they want to make, or a related subject they were reminded of. It keeps people from interrupting, shouting over one another and forgetting what they wanted to say. \n\nMy mother is getting older and is constantly afraid that if she doesn't say something as soon as she thinks it, she'll forget it. Because of this, she was constantly interrupting everyone while they tried to speak. The urge to choke her until she was quiet was growing strong in the family, when I saw a lawyer of some TV show scratching down notes on the opposing lawyers opening statement. Something clicked, and now at Sunday dinners we keep a few post-it note pads and some pens on the table. The conversations are much more civil. And as an added bonus, when someone sees you scribble down a quick note, they know that you want to say something. \n\nJust a stupid idea I had, but it seems to work for my family.   ",

            "selftext": "I want to start a news station or channel on the internet. I want to do this for two reasons. Make something that people can actually like watching and is organized well and make a living while doing that.\n\nWhat is wrong with the news today? CNN and other channels? I don't have an exhaustive list and hope you can help add to my lists...\n\n1. **Don't show great footage of downed airplanes or crashes or what not** - Vice News does do the good footage though. So better footage like that. More in depth.\n\n2. **Not balanced.** - They yell or just say crazy stuff. Hannity yells like a crazy person and many other folks do too instead of civil conversation. If you have two or more viewpoints people should stay civil and not use insults and such.\n\n3. **Bad details.** - They just spout bad details as fact without telling that they are just guessing. I have had two times in my family where the news reporters straight up lied and messed with the information for their story.\n\n4. **Unfair Gender Bias** This world has both genders and even some other variations so a show should not have insults to men or women unnecessarily. Facts should not be distorted to serve one or the other. No hate for men or women should be done.\n\n5. **Pro liberal or pro conservative. Political bias.** - I'm a centrist myself and feel that if people want to have their view shown on issues it should be shown with both sides or a centered view. That way people can make up their own mind. This could be done by taking viewpoints from both sides and playing them in succession or side by side.\n\n6. **Information lacking.** - Many news reports use language that is just wrong. That is my reason for posting today actually. News reporters are talking about 4chan like it is a person and not a group. They have no idea what they are talking about and didn't even use Google to find out. If they don't have info on the tech, they should get someone that knows about it or do some research. If they are not sure they should say they have little information but their quick research gave them such and such information.\n\n7. **Atheistic or religious biases.** - Many times you will get biases in the religious department. Sometimes christian, sometimes atheistic, sometimes neither. I'm ok with neither but if using one viewpoint the other should have its viewpoint illustrated as well. No heavy handed biasing towards one or another when talking about it either. Basically don't talk about one side like it is glorious and the other one is crap.\n\n8. **Heavy bias towards only the negatives of something or other.** - If talking about police in a bad way it would be good to also talk about some good police as well and talk negatively towards the bad actions but really awesome towards the good actions. Use this balanced approach to influence better behavior of all groups. Also give people information and tools that enable them to help things out such as telling them how to say thanks to good police and how to report bad police safely. Stuff like that. Also not talk about only death and bad stuff all the time. Balance that stuff out.\n\n9. **Garbage information.** - News and TV needs useful information such as PSAs, technology updates that are actually well researched so the news folks don't come off looking stupid or too skeptical. Information for people needing jobs such as how to do a better resume and how to cook in college and other useful things would be good to add. Improve the minds of the masses instead of just feeding them garbage death stories, stupid fluff stories, and misinformation about subjects they don't know about.\n\n10. **Government or corporation influenced.** - TV should not be influenced by the government or corporations in what they do. It is terrible to let that happen. Good information should be given to the people of the world. That is the purpose of news stations. They are to give accurate, quality, hard hitting information for the people to use in their lives and decision making.\n\n11. **Logical fallacies** - It is hard to get away from logical fallacies but making it a rule not to use them in reports and shows should be something done. Keep things clean.\n\n**What should have:**\n\n1. Quality Footage of things they are talking about if they can at all get it. We are not children and this world is a cruel place so the footage should be shown. Plane crash, dead bodies, animations of how a device works, etc.\n\n2. Accuracy. If information is not known, then make sure to say what is speculation when speculating. Something like \"Our team speculates that this could be XYZ but right now we are not sure. We will update  you if we find out more information and have time to.\"\n\n3. Balanced and centrist information and viewpoints. If you have something like abortion on the block to talk about then have both religious and atheist viewpoints and if possible have people from each group able to talk. Even a series of people. If a political issue then have both a liberal and conservative talk. If you have a gender issue have a man and woman talk. No extremest biasing. Let the people make up their own mind and have multiple viewpoints to reconcile themselves. One other major point is no yelling or insults or logical fallacies will be allowed. People will be penalized if they do this and it will be made clear to the viewers.\n\nIt should cover these things:\n\n* World News\n\n* Local News (this is just a technical issue that is easily resolved)\n\n*technology updates\n\n* small and concise pop culture news such as rehab and releases or actors deaths or what not\n\n* history that day in the past that is balanced and not biased\n\n* PSAs and tutorials for things: Time Relevant (heatwaves, driving in snow) , College Student Cooking, Cooking while living on your own for the first time, Life living on your own for the first time, how to pick clothes that are suitable for work and other situations for both men and women, internet issues like SOPA and net neutrality, etc.\n\n* Updates: Movie releases for the week in theaters and on DVD, technology like xbox or playstation new consoles, big video game releases such as cod or halo or what not, etc.\n\n* Shows with subject matters like: How science things work, how technology items work, how to live in an apartment well, how to build your own houseboat, how to fish and cut it up and cook it process, how to hunt from start to finish, new gadgets, new technologies, how to buy a house and why you should or shouldn't, how to do good with your finances and credit using things like creditkarma and mint.com and staying away from payday loans, how to not suck with people and get amazing social skills, etc. This overlaps a bit with the PSAs and probably needs cleaned up.\n\nWhat other things would you like to see as PSAs, shows, and variables that should be considered when making a news station or tv channel that doesn't suck?\n\nI am thinking about doing this online for both making something that is useful and so I can have something to do as a small business and manage it with other intelligent and awesome people. Making money from this wouldn't be the hard part. The hard part is deciding the structure and parameters that go into it.",

This is something I believe is endemic on the free sites (OKC, POF). It's essentially like Craigslist, where you post an ad, someone offers to buy and then doesn't show up - there's no accountability, which makes the process really frustrating. \n\nSo the idea is a dating website that allows each individual the ability to gain a sort of karma by sending messages, being polite, being a gentleman, etc. For example, a well thought out message could gain +1 while a 'yo babe lets see dem tits' would get -1. The more points, the more desirable that individual is, the more the profile is promoted, etc. Cancel on a date at the last minute? -10. Try to have sex the first night? -20, etc. Of course, those points would be at the discretion of the offended party. \n\nAnyway, just an idea. \n\n",

Even if those cars exit off, the algorithm would be smart enough to keep going.

            "selftext": "Ok, so this one came to me today. It was about 95\u00b0 out, and people were driving with their windows down. Why? Why not just use their air conditioning? Because a lot of cars' air conditioning does not work, that's why. Want to go get it fixed? That'll be anywhere from 200-400$.\n\n BUT (here's where my idea comes in) what if you could just plug a seperate air conditioner, probably around the size of somewhere between the slim ps2 and the fat one, into your cigarette lighter? Put it on your dash, on the passenger seat, maybe in the backseat if the cord is long enough. Sell this handy tool for <100$ and BAM it'll sell like fucking crazy. An air conditioner for small spaces, not just cars. Dorms, tents, really anything small enough that you don't need a giant air conditioner or want to spend a lot of money on one.\n\n Why spend 200 on fixing your air conditioner when you could spend 80 on one that works just as good? Why spend 250 on a big air conditioner that is built for a house when you can spend 80 on one that cools down a much smaller area? \n\nPlease let me know what you think",

Over a period of 4-8 years, a voting coalition working, non-partisanly, to prevent reelection of all officials, regardless of party, could help to root out cronyism and favoritism, and make politicians realize that long-term power is impossible. Corporations will also realize that investing in politicians is ill-advised, as those favors can only be called in over a short period of time. \n\nFormer politicians would not be able to have influence in the government as lobbyists because everyone they had relationships with has now been voted out of office. Their ability to get face time and sway powerful people is now void. All those powerful people are in the same position as our lobbyist friend, completely removed from the halls of power, which are now occupied by neophytes.\n\n Over time, the psychopathic power-seeking individuals will no longer pursue the limited power available in government, and a better crop of candidates would arise. Third parties would become more viable, as a large portion of people would vote for a third party over Dems/Repubs if they felt they were not throwing their vote away. Anti-corruption tickets would become popular. \n\nVoting against incumbency en masse is like a vote of no confidence in our current government.  If it could be accomplished three cycles in a row, the face of government could be changed forever. \n\n   Would that be a positive change?

For example, the Sunni tribes in Anbar that the US supported in 2008, now are working with ISIS and probably using the same weapons that the US gave them.

            "selftext": "Calm down. I'm not advocating complete defilement of your precious and pretty OS.\n\nI heard Steve jobs wanted to license Mac OS back when Apple was bigger than Microsoft, but then he got kicked out. Fast forward one decade and the numbers have reversed. Failing to adapt meant apple got left behind. Yes, I know they only cater to the high market today, but from a business point of view, their market is comprised of the top 5%. Yes, their market cap is like $500 billion, more than MS, google combined (I heard). \n\nI myself am on the Windows & Android team. Both these platforms offer amazing flexibility that neither Mac OS nor iOS gives. But I can't help but envy the seamless integration between the Apple device range. iPhones and Macs play along nicely in a way Windows and Android just don't. Plus they could use a design and aesthetics lesson or two from Apple. \n\nPutting Apple on the map in the competitive (low) price range, could potentially change this. If Apple doesn't want to do this, don't. They could simply license their OS. Apple gets to enter a significantly bigger market, while maintaining the *oomph* of Apple's iPhones and Macs.\n\nJust brainstorming. What do you think?",

            "selftext": "So I had this idea. You include a small piece of code in a website (preferably *every* website) that does two things. \n\n1. It tracks how many viewers the site has and the time they spend viewing.\n\n2. It forces viewers to use a small percentage of their total CPU power to solve calculations.\n\nThe website gets paid a certain amount based on how many users they can attract, and how long they can keep them on the site. This incentivizes them to make/host interesting in-depth content, rather than click-bait.\n\nOn the back end, all of these calculations and processes are distributed by you. \n\n1. Assuming that every visitor is running an average computer (with a speed of 3.1GHz, the avg in the U.S.) \n\n2. and the website uses 1% of each viewers processing power. \n\n*NOTE: these are raw numbers, without accounting for transmission delay or anything else. Rough approximations, in other words.*\n\nby my calculations (I've always wanted to say that), you would have access to what amounts to a **31.8GHz** processor for each 1000 concurrent visitors.\n\nFor example, if Facebook were using this system: they have ~450k users at any one time. Alone, they would produce a network capable of 14,310 GHz. You could do all sorts of awesome things with that much processing power, and there would have to be a way to make money from it. You make money, and relay some of that cash to the websites that participate. No one needs to use advertisement to support their site anymore.\n\nEDIT: [Crowdprocess](https://crowdprocess.com/) is doing exactly this.",

For example text based ads in the browser tool bar, pop ups, pop under's, home page re-direction etc...\n\nThis is beneficial for the ISP's because it offers them new revenue streams and it allows new start up ISP's to have a unique edge over their competitors.\n\nAnd it's beneficial to consumers because the same as free forms of TV, Radio and Print there is an exchange and an understanding that a small interruption of paid advertising will allow them to have free internet.\n\nIf users don't want to see ads and are happy to pay for the general service of no-ads then they can pay the ISP for it no different to how they currently do it.\n\nThis type of service would essentially be great for low income families, students, the elderly and generally anyone that does not have the money to pay for the Internet or would like to save that money and use it for other goods and services.\n\nBusinesses and third parties such as marketing agencies would obviously benefit because it gives them a new medium to target their audiences with.\n\nPlease comment with thoughts and opinions.",

Twice as slow as 120fps, 1/4 the speed of real life. \n\n**Math**\n\nConversion is really easy, first you lop off a zero or move a decimal one place to the left on the camera's FPS stat, then you take the first few non-zero digits on the left and divide by 6, which is easy since it will usually be a factor of 60. \n\n1.  24,000\n\n2. 2,400\n\n3. 2,400 / 6 = 400 \n\na camera that shoots at 24,000 fps is 400 second-seconds.

Really, its just attaching a board to your feet as you skydive, and performing rotations and such as you free fall. This sort of gave me a crazy idea. Its completely theoretical, and if anything I would just like to know why it WOULDN'T work, or some discussion on the idea. What would happen if you were to attach a very small version of an aircraft engine, to the bottom of the board? OR maybe not even an aircraft engine, just something to propel the board OUTWARDS instead of just free falling downwards. Main reason I think this could go haywire is because having 6 degrees of freedom while falling, and exerting a force in one direction seems like it might just cause a massive amount of spinning. \n\nSo, thoughts?",

Although I'm not sure whether this is a good idea... Clearly, it wasn't a very good idea to trust people with phones in their cars, I don't think we should be giving ourselves any more entertainment in cars. Perhaps this could be bypassed by only allowing the projector to turn on when the car's speed is zero.\n\nEDIT: It could be further expanded to be a gaming station as well. Imagine a racing game being projected at all the windows and the windshield to depict your, the driver's POV. Although I don't know if it would be possible to somehow modify the steering wheel/ gears and pedals to connect to the game when the engine is off.. Still.. pretty fucking awesome.",

Humans have a typical shape, even accounting for things like varying weight it's pretty easy to notice something bipedal standing with shoulders and legs. What if the windshield on a car could be used to recognise people on the road or even better other cars/people/animals in situations with low visibility such as Fog? Ideally it would provide a red outline which could include things like distance tags. \n\nI've tried searching online for something similar, the closest thing I could find is a [Research blog from Google](http://googleresearch.blogspot.co.uk/2014/09/building-deeper-understanding-of-images.html) which shows how neural pathways could be used to identify things like dogs or hats. \n\nThanks for reading my first post!\n",

Now, uranium constantly emits neutrons and they collide with other uranium atoms causing a chain reaction, or they may collide with lead atoms multiple times and then get absorbed. Atoms vibrate AKA produce heat.\n\nI'm not sure but there must be a sweet spot where the temperature of the lead sphere is say 80 degrees Celsius. If so, it could effectively act as a heater that'll remain hot for millions of years. It could be used in arctic regions, places that are cold throughout the year. \n\nSure, uranium is costly. But we're talking millions of years. Practically, nobody would build it I think, but still, it's kinda cool.\n\nCan someone with more knowledge back this up?

            "selftext": "In cities that have grown up with he automobile, bicycles are marginalized.  Roads are designed for cars; subways and buses are designed for pedestrians.  Despite this state of affairs, even in these sorts of cities, there are some really good places for biking.  The problem is that those places are disjoint from each other, separated by traffic barriers and/or too much distance.  We should build a cyclist transit system to connect those islands of bikeability.  \n\nHere's one way it could be done.  Identify a couple of promising locations and connect them with what is essentially a [Shweeb](http://www.shweeb-can.com) line, except with one major difference.  Instead of the pods being designed for a pedestrian, they're instead designed for a cyclist.  You ride/roll your own bike into the pod and crank your own pedals to drive the pod along the track.  A treadmill or wheel system converts the power from your bike's drive wheel into power to move your pod along the track.\n\nIt starts out as basically just a gimmick, an amusement park ride.  See the city from a unique perspective!  Only $15!  Blah, blah, blah.  \n\nBut it's designed to be upgraded.  The fully realized version has a lot more track, an electrified rail, a sophisticated control system, and pods with GPS and climate control.  In the final version, the system will add electrical power to ramp up your speed.  Depending on your willingness to pay, you can get different levels of speed amplification.  The system will also keep track of the pods' speeds and locations and facilitate multi-pod train formation and ensure that no pod can slow down any other pod.  Any slowpokes with a combination of weak pedal effort and low choice of speed amplification will have the electrical power to their pod increased by enough to prevent their inconveniencing anyone else (and they will be fined to cover the extra).\n\nThe fully implemented system would have several advantages.  \n\nIt's a personal system.  No sharing space with dozens of other commuters like with traditional transit.  You also never have to touch anything except your own bicycle.\n\nIt is much safer than riding a bike in traffic, because it is separated completely from unpredictable car and pedestrian traffic.  \n\nMost important, it could be the fastest way to get around.  Because all passengers will have bicycles, stations can be quite far apart compared to bus or subway.  Less time stopped at stations means shorter travel times.  Also, unlike a car, there will be no time stopped at lights, at stop signs, or in traffic.",

            "selftext": "Is there anything wrong with the idea of using 3D printing techniques with abundant desert sand into blocks or modular panels for cheap building materials? \n\nMy idea is, roughly, have a large facility located in or near a prominent desert, like the Sahara or the Gobi, that would be primarily solar powered. It would take in plain old desert sand, funnel it into a crucible, use a large lens assembly to melt the medium (much like some 3D printers), and pour the fluid medium to make thick glass blocks or interlocking panels for use in local construction. \n\nPros:\n\n1. After the initial investment, the facility would be very cheap to run. The two most common expenses would be the staff and the transportation. Materials and energy would be next to free.\n2. Glass can be a great building material. If you have doubts, picture sandstone, the material that the Great Pyramids are made from. Make the walls of a structure out of 8\" thick glass, with some simple minerals added to turn it into a crude Pyrex and some rebar to reinforce it like concrete, and you have a structure that can withstand the harsh desert for generations.\n3. Making sand a useful material would incentiveize more people to collect it, helping many border towns and villages fight back the creeping sand dunes that are slowly engulfing their homes.\n\nCons: \n\n1. Glass, although strong and durable, is very brittle. When it breaks, it breaks in a big way. Demolition crews would have to deal with a billion glass shards and particulates if they aren't careful.\n\n2. Relying chiefly on solar power would limit the factory to operating solely in the daylight hours, maybe 10 hours a day, tops.\n \n3. The lens assemblies would probably be very complicated and expensive, requiring maintenance regularly.\n\nPerhaps replacing the focused-light melting process with some kind of electric crucible would overcome Con #2. Is there anything else?\n\nWhat do you think?",

Solar cells their would be pretty much 'overclocked', although IDK if too much radiation can wreck them. For power, we can use other methods as well.\n\nLike put a closed tank of water (or some other liquid) on the surface, it will boil then the steam can be used to rotate a turbine to get electricity, and the cooled steam can be re-routed to the water tank.\n\nIf we're ever going to mercury we'll have to go underground somewhere close to the poles, where sunlight isn't that direct (given that [mercury's temperature](https://www.google.com/search?q=temperature+dark+side+of+mercury&gws_rd=ssl#q=temperature+mercury) fluctuates from 430 to -170 degrees Celsius). I'm sure we can find a relatively normal position where the whether remains like 100-200 on the surface most of the year.\n\nMercury's magnetic field is [1.1% that of the earth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury's_magnetic_field). That means the planet is pretty much dead on the inside. So, unlike earth, we can dig down deep into mercury and not reach a lava layer relatively soon. Again, I'm not sure but it should be cooler down below, say 5-15 kilometers underground. \n\nSo, we can have our power station at the surface and an army of a variety of robots. One kind can handle the digging. Another kind can then process all that dug up stuff to get out iron and silicates to smelt into a fairly strong material (there's very little gravity, so we don't need so much strength). Another kind can do the actual building. \n\nJust brainstorming here, what do you think?",

Even then, practical knowledge is far apart from what we're taught in class.\n\nIn computer science, you learn basic programming languages. That's like learning alphabets. For example, learning Java is like learning the ABCD needed to create android apps. You still gotta learn how to make words and sentences and that's a whole other thing.\n\nIf someone wants to get into 3D modeling, they might never even need anything taught in a computer science course (except for advanced low level rendering stuff). Just learn Maya or 3DSMax or Blender and you are ready for 90% of 3D modeling jobs in the real world. \n\nEducation is no longer education. It's a business. How can we change that? Stop requiring degrees, start looking at the person's actual abilities to judge whether they are suitable for the job. Exams don't say shit about what a person can do, the education system is inherently flawed. \n\nWant to hire an android developer? Don't ask for degrees, ask what all he has uploaded to the play store. Want to hire a video artist? Don't ask for degrees, ask him to show you what he can do with Adobe After effects. \n\nJust brainstorming... Ideas?",

            "selftext": "Today I met a man who patented a technology that he was trying to get petition signatures for. \n\nNow, normally I am hugely turned off by this kind of thing, and just ignore petitioners or wait until they're done talking and brush them off.\nThis guy had a great idea though, and it's already patented.\n\nWhen a vehicles airbags are deployed, or the rollover sensors are triggered, the device activates battery backup power and engages the hazard lights. It also strobes the tail lights, reverse lights, and headlights for maximum visibility and warning to other drivers.\n\nThe reason this guy is pushing for this device to become mandatory on all vehicles is more realistic than you think. \"Chain reaction\" accidents are a common occurrence, and the secondary drivers almost always state that they simply did not see what was going on clearly, or that the vehicle they crashed into had no electricity, and therefore no lights, and therefore was a sitting target in the dark.\n\nI believe that this device is a great idea and I am supporting this man's decision to ask the manufacturers to make it a mandatory component on all vehicles. We already have unique indicators for things; one blinking yellow is lane changes, two blinking yellows is a hazard, white is a vehicle backing up, etc. Emergency vehicles always have strobing lights to alert others to their presence and let you know without a doubt that it's an emergency. So when a vehicle is in a crash it's an emergency and our vehicles should flash when there's a major accident.\n\nWhy should broken glass and hazard lights be the first warning signs that drivers get when an accident is ahead? Strobing lights always mean an emergency. What say you, Reddit?",

Now, instead of hiring teachers in schools, instead of even going to schools, all education could be done from anywhere anytime and most importantly at any 'rate'. That is, students study at their own pace and students decide what they want to study. \n\nWhy? I quote from The matrix \"Because some things never change and some things do\". It's safe to assume the basics of electromagnetism, trigonometry, organic chemistry etc. will never change for decades. When they do change or when new fields come up we can always create more material. I realize that this will leave 99% of the teachers jobless.. But we can always have some teachers in sort of a forum or a live/group chat thingy where students can ask doubts and get answers.\n\nMost children don't realize why school is important. I say let them take a break, an year off after primary/middle school. Let them explore the world, let the see what all has been done, let them find their passion and work towards it. Let them see how the real world works and exactly why school is necessary. \n\nThere's a fuckton of difference between being forced to study and wanting to study.\n\nInstead of schools, children decide their own path in life. They'll make mistakes, but guess what? They're children, they can afford to make mistakes. I'd be very surprised that childhood infatuations completely die out. Who the fuck wouldn't want to become an astronaut if there's zero risk/cost? \n\nOf course, it's not like we should completely leave it up to them. We should have certain standard courses that everyone has to take. Yes, 90% (or something) of the population will never for one second require knowledge of calculus, trigonometry but guess what? Maths makes you smarter, less monkey, more human. I never liked it, but I always knew it was important even if I'd never need it. We can have some compulsory courses, like english, some field in science etc.\n\nAnd schools could be 'downsized' to function only as 'examination centers'\n\nJust brainstorming here, I'm sure this idea is flawed in many ways. But it is also better than the current system in many ways. What do you think?",

Basically a non-profit would be created that would create objective pamphlets with three concrete things that each candidate in an election wants to do. It would be phrased in language as simple as possible, and be available of course in English, Spanish, Vietnamese, and others.\n\nThese pamphlets would be created first for national elections. If the non-profit had enough support, it could also create pamphlets for individual state and even local elections.\n\nInitially, the \"three things\" would be decided by the organization itself with consulting help ensuring people from all sides feel satisfied. If the non-profit grew, it could actually request the \"three things\" from the campaigns themselves (though the organization might have to reject submissions until they are actually given three concrete things and not just stump speeches).\n\nThese pamphlets would be distributed by volunteers door-to-door. First priority would be areas with more poverty and less education, but with more funding the pamphlets could be distributed ideally absolutely everywhere. They would of course be available in digital form as well.\n\nAnother thing that could happen if the program was big enough is that the organization could release a \"rough draft\" of the pamphlets a couple of weeks before the official release, gauge the reaction, make necessary edits to promote fairness, and then make the official release.\n\nThe organization could of course work with voter registration groups and other groups to help with dispersing the pamphlets.",

            "selftext": "I've been thinking about this for a while and found this subreddit and decided to share. \n\nBasically, a company that has a bunch of 3-D printers and sewing machines and cutters can carry this out. [Fab labs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fab_lab) already have this, but on a small scale. A person calls the company to order something custom made. For instance, they need a carved car handle or a shirt with a certain design of theirs. Basically anything lighter than [insert weight here], smaller than [volume] and that doesn't require electricity to work. The person sends a specific description, design, or set of criteria and the quantity of the product. The company makes an estimate as to the price+shipping and the person decides whether or not he still wants whatever it is. If the person wants to speed up the process, he can say right away that he will buy the item if it is below (or at) a certain price and won't if it is above it, so the company could bill him and skip the negotiations. Finally, the company uses their technology to make and ship the product to the person that ordered it.\n\nThe idea is that when someone wants to either give someone a unique gift or he/she wants to create an invention that requires some part that cannot be found in a store he/she can order it at this company. If it has a big enough factory with divisions for different kinds of jobs (sewing, 3-D printing, carving, cutting, etc.), the company can actually thrive. Of course, its products will be more expensive, but they will be that much more special. I've always dreamed of this kind of thing, and would love to see it happen.\n\nThanks for reading my idea. I hope I've inspired someone. Notify me if you know of that kind of thing or start it. I'll be your first customer. In fact, if it's near me, I can work there if you let me. You'll recognize me because I'll tell you when the narwhal bacons on the resume.\n\nP. S. I know that the 3-D printers will have to be heavy-duty and everything, but I think there's some like that.",

            "selftext": " I admire the popular Youtube channel Vsauce's main host, Michael Stevens, and his quirky interrogations, his attempts to research a bizarre question that people don't normally ask and broadcast the answer \u2013  and I notice how his answers are often sprinkled with mind-boggling facts and scientifically dense information \u2013 into a succinctly short video format.\n\n What I wanted to create is a game in which people would learn how to interrogate questions typically found in academia or intellectual communities along with progressive educational factors added into the experience to make it a unique game that would ultimately empower your thinking skills.\n\n Anyway, firstly you sign up with a standard email, date of birth, and age. Continuing on, once you've completed the registration, you confirm your email address and head back over the site. And now that you've finished that, you log in to the dashboard, and see a map of disciplines, designed similar to a mind-map. \n\nPicture the Khan Academy Knowledge Map, except the dashboard is a giant map of academic disciplines and creative disciplines, like the humanities, sciences, and painting for example. Your next step is to narrow down a discipline into a sub-discipline. \n\nSo let's say you clicked on the humanity discipline bubble, and now upon clicking, there are smaller sub-discipline bubbles. We'll choose philosophy as a sub-discipline of the humanities for instance. Now upon clicking on that, the final step is to narrow it down into a branch of topic. So let's suppose you chose ethics. Moving on, now you need to select how your game style will work. The main premise of this game is to build a question out of that topic out of a pair(s) of topics, so upon clicking on the ethics bubble, you'll get a pop-up asked if you're sure you want to select that one or choose a different one. Now the map will redirect to a new page, and you'll come across a page of game play options. \n\nYou can then select the number of associated concepts from one up to five, whether the topics will come from the same discipline, the same sub-discipline, down to the topic, or something different altogether from the map. \n\n Once this is finished,  the final ''pregame'' page is redirected, in which you select the options of how the associated concepts are presented. You have the option of a randomized number of micro-lectures, puzzles, or interactive exercises, or a set number again. These exercises are specifically designed by a team as well as handpicked from the internet and books ect. (e.g. a website article comparing ethics and artificial intelligence) and stored in a generator. They are also backed with scientific divergent thinking research to exercise someone's ability to combine what they learned the topic with the associated concepts and create something new, which will subsequently induce asking more original questions. Finally, after that, once you click next, you come to a new page that starts with a timer counting down.\n\n Upon counting down, you complete the first exercise or, alternatively, if it's too difficult, get a new one, or a number of hints, in a limited amount. You also earn points if the question has original or interesting variables, according to a computer database. Once you completed one, a check mark appears on the screen, and before you continue on to the next one, you have a large word box to type in a question. \n\n This is timed to about five minutes, then gradually decreases to five seconds on the most difficult round. You can theoretically do this for an infinite number of rounds, until you are either unable to ask a question in the time slot or the question is too close to a question asked in popularity around the community, which is also judged in the computer database. As you ask questions, your portfolio of questions increases, and you can see them on your profile. Each question, if it is judged original or insightful according to the computer, may be promoted to academic institutions and research centers. I'm interested in hearing your opinion, including the good and the bad, of this draft idea.",

            "selftext": "Programmers generally adhere to the philosophy that single-character variables (and other non-descriptive variable names) are bad.  Why?  Because looking at code, it's impossible to figure out what it does unless you have memorized what each variable name means.  So it's better to have something like  \n    \n    price=cost*items  \ninstead of:  \n\n    p=c*i\n\nBut look at the wikipedia page for the [Stefan-Boltzmann law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan%E2%80%93Boltzmann_law).  It contains several equations that you cannot decipher without first knowing what several letters and greek characters represent.  So just figuring out what is written is a task in itself.  \n\nWhy not something like \"Radiation = SBConstant x Temperature^4\" instead of \"R=\u03c3T^4\" ?  The first one contains everything you need to know, while the second assumes you already know everything about the equation but the order the variables are in.  If you want to teach something, all the information should be there in one place.\n",

The math works like this: 365/8 = 45.625 or 45 Weeks and an extra week of 5 Days. So, similarly to how we occasionally change the calendar for a leap day, this will become the norm and people will just be ok with it.\n\nBut here is where the brilliance comes in, 4 day weekends. What? Oh? How? Let me explain: Each job will have two people working it. The first person will work Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday for 10 hours each day. They will then have the following 4 days off. This is where the next person picks up and runs the position, working their 4 days. Not only will this increase productivity due to having someone working the job all the time, each person will be more rested due to the 4 day weekend and will be more productive while working as well. Plus, having two people work a single job will mean unemployment will go down as we will need a larger workforce.\n\nThis obviously wouldn't work for every job, but there is always an exception to the rule. It would take time and there would be a bit of a learning curve, but I think the world would be better for it.",

There's not been greater interest in football both domestically and globally than there is at this point in time so I feel like now would be the time do it.\n\nI'm not sure how licensing for this stuff works so it might have to be fictionalised teams (like in Any Given Sunday), but if not, a team around the upper mid-table of the Premiership, or maybe even a top 4 club. Could be introduced through the eyes of the protagonist, a new transfer into the club from smaller team. I understand that this falls dangerously close to turning into the \"GOAL!\" films, but if done properly (hence why I suggested BBC/HBO etc), I reckon it would gain a mass following, at least in the UK. And it wouldn't need a hell of a budget either.\n\nIt could deal with player relationships on and off the pitch, and how the new guy deals with a sudden boost in cash and lifestyle as well as trying to keep in touch with his roots and old life. Competition for places. Backroom troubles and financial issues which the manager and chairman have to deal with; maybe a troublesome foreign owner too. \n\nHonestly, just came to me. It could end up like \"Entourage\" crossed with \"Top Boy\" and \"Boardwalk Empire\", or it could be some \"Footballer's Wives\"x\"GOAL!\" monstrosity hybrid.\n\nDream cast would be:\nLiam Cunningham - the manager of the club\nGary Oldman - joint chairman\nEmma Thompson - joint chairman\n\n\nPlayers\n\nIdris Elba - veteran captain of the team\n\nTom Hardy - hardman defensive mid\n\nKevin McKidd \n\nDominic West - another aging player; antithesis to Elba and maybe tries to undermine him and take control of the team?\n\nAshley Walters - (from Top Boy...and So Solid Crew)\n\nJohn Boyega - (from Attack the Block (and soon to be Star Wars VII))\n\nThen I'm thinking someone young(ish) for the protagonist player, like Eddie Redmayne or Sam Claflin. Unfortunately not too clued up on current, young European actors but you'd need some as players to represent a modern team with all the imported transfers too. ",

            "selftext": "I'm building a social networking site that will replace Facebook, and I'm calling it Hitlr.  I fully understand how crazy that sounds, but I know I can make the idea work.  This idea is pretty out there, so I really need to know how others perceive it.  Below is a brief description of what it might look like, I would love your feedback, any and all comments are welcome.  \n\n\n**What is Hitlr?**\n\nThe moment our parents taught us to say please and thank you, we began the process of becoming better communicators. The moment we began communicating through Advice Animals and reaction gifs, that process stopped. Our current social networking options have failed us, they do not aid us in the process of becoming better communicators. We need a tool that gives comprehensive feedback and focused data on how we communicate, a real social network. That tool is Hitlr.\n\n**Why call it Hitlr?**\n\nCalling this social network Hitlr, acts as a social commentary on multiple levels. First, it goes against the trend of social media start ups that use increasingly meaingless semi-words(Facebook, Instagram) and sounds (Twitter, Yik Yak) to identify it\u2019s brand. Rather, one of the most infamous words in many languages is re appropriated to mean the opposite of what it has in the past. A word that was synomous with evil, hatred and bigotry, will come to be synonomous with communication, collaboration and acceptance. It will be the ultimate mockery of a genocidal maniac and his funny mustache when I can (equivalent of) like my nieces Chanukah presents on Hitlr.\n\nHitlr, as a brand, will accomplish two goals critical to early adoption and success of the social network. First, Hitlr plays off the edgy humor popular with millennials and the social media generation. Second, the name will generate some controversy, this will provide free publicity for the company when it needs it the most. Hitlr was specifically chosen as a way to get around the barriers to entry that many other social networking start-ups face. Hitlr is a form of satire, the brand will never be used as a form of attack on any indivdual or group.\n\nHitlr will challenge what may be the golden rule of persuasion, don\u2019t associate your message with Hitler. When Hitlr is successful, it will make a profound statement about long held ideas of what constitutes effective communication. This is Hitlr\u2019s primary goal.",

But meh too much effort.\n\nThen I had an idea, wouldn't it be good if we could look up any news reporter or journalist (is there a difference?) or even bloggers etc, and see a list of articles they've published under their name?\n\nThis would definitely make them more accountable, as it would be very easy for readers to verify some of the things they write by comparing to older article. Especially those with controversial opinions.\n\nUnfortunately, quite often I see articles published with no author (sometimes these are syndicated articles) which means they would stay anonymous, but if they have nothing to hide?\n\n**TL;DR:** An online register of all web based news journalists, to make them more accountable for the articles they write.\n\n(I expect someone to tell me this already exists)\n\nThoughts?",

I liked it better compared to the traditional lamps that stand from the ground because it looks more modern. However, in my room in my ceiling there are no wiring for a light. Is it possible to maybe install that myself? What if i were to wire it from the light on the ceiling right outside the door and use a long wire maybe? Should I just give up and buy a traditional lamp? Thank you so much reddit I hope this works!",

Of all of the games that people use to kill time, none of them draw me in as much as Pokemon (even the other monster-training apps for smartphones don't quite do it for me).  I don't feel like getting a Nintendo DS (or 3DS, or whatever the most recent Nintendo handheld console is), but I still want to play the latest Pokemon games.  I know I could do this on an emulator, but playing the games on your computer is just not the same; there is something about Pokemon that seems like it's meant to be played on the go.  So my solution would be for Nintendo to make versions of their handheld consoles that didn't have a cartridge slot.  Instead, they would be pre-installed with Pokemon and could be used for **only** Pokemon.  I would buy it, and I know others would too.  There are many of us out there who don't want a DS but want to play Pokemon like we used to.",

Daily tournaments with prizes by age bracket.  There could be an area in which, multiple times each day kids can meet the characters and have their pictures taken.\n\nAs for the casino, all slot games would adapt Nintendo characters into new slot games.  (Ie. a game featuring Mario and the bonus rounds might include saving the princess in a mini game, or a screen of bricks.  As you pick the bricks Mario jumps up and breaks them revealing award amounts.  You would get to continue until you picked \"Collect\".)  The hotel would be castle themed and titled \"Hyrule Castle\" or perhaps just \"Hyrule\" (Maybe \"The Mushroom Kingdom\" and have that as the main theme?)\n\nMy thoughts on the hotel rooms would include an officia Nintendo all-in-one emulator box in every room.  Older system games would be free to play (Nintendo, SNES and GC.  Everything after would have a nominal rental fee per day depending on the game.  \n\n",

            "selftext": "This is a bit long, so feel free to skip to the 'TL;DR' at the end. Also note the 'may not entirely know what I'm talking about' down at the bottom.\n\nLately I've been looking into things like Google's [Project Loon](http://www.google.com/loon/#utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=Global_semBK) and [Satellite-based plans](http://www.theverge.com/2014/6/2/5771322/google-reportedly-launching-180-satellites-for-worldwide-internet), as well as Facebook's (IMO much less plausible) [Drone-based plan](http://www.theverge.com/2014/3/27/5555060/facebook-plans-to-bring-world-online-with-fleet-of-solar-powered-drones) - all plans to bring reliable internet connectivity everywhere in the world. Now to my knowledge, none of these plans essentially involve free internet access, but in discussions with friends the question of 'why not?' has come up quite a bit.\n\nNow there's the obvious business-based answer; these plans will require an enormous investment and whatever company undertakes these plans will be seeking a return on that investment. I feel that this isn't necessarily the whole story. Imagine that Google's Project Loon winds up being a tremendous success and every location on the planet now has reliable access to the internet - Google here has two options; charge for the service or offer it for free. The problem with the option of charging is that it may not represent a significant long-term benefit: Internet via Loon is very unlikely to be high-bandwidth, and will likely be much slower and less reliable than land-based options, therefore any given location where a large segment of the population is paying for internet access via Loon will represent a prime developing market for land-based ISPs. In other words, if Project Loon is a paid service, it will act as the perfect market-research tool for its competitors.\n\nIf on the other hand Google does not charge for internet access via Loon, it never has to worry about competition from land-based ISPs; it will act as the slower, less reliable, lower-bandwidth, free option, and land-based ISPs will here be acting as the better-quality pay-based alternative. This already fits well with Google's business model; they make their revenue in advertisement and (essentially) in attracting users, not by acting as an ISP. Google is already doing things like this with Fiber, offering a lower-bandwidth free internet option.\n\nThere is one additional issue which has come up with the 'free' option in discussions I've had; the problem of over-use. The argument is essentially this: Unlike Google fiber, the point of Loon is to be everywhere, and thus if it were provided completely free, there would be no reason for any user device (i.e. every device capable of connecting to LTE) to ever disconnect (unless in the range of a more preferred network of course). This represents an unreasonable strain on the network - its simply too much traffic, and it seems even more insurmountable when you consider the rate at which internet-capable devices are proliferating throughout the world.\n\nThe idea I have is a potential solution to this over-use issue: Don't offer unrestricted internet via Loon for free (whew, that was easy huh?), instead, offer a Siri-like service for free, and offer unrestricted internet at a reasonably low price. What I mean by a 'Siri-like' service is essentially access to the web with mediation. If I wanted to look up the height of Kilimanjaro from halfway up its slope, I would use my phone to ask Loon 'what is the height of Kilimanjaro?', and Loon would return an answer for me. If I then wished to purchase a new pair of climbing boots, I would tell Loon to display some options for this, or possibly to connect to the specific website of a store I'm looking to shop from. If I then wanted to speak to leave a facebook message on my friend's wall, I could tell Loon to do this for me. Hopefully you get the idea - the service would allow for connection to the internet, but only through a mediated interaction. Thus while almost all user devices would be connected to Loon almost all the time, the actual network itself couldn't be put under constant load. One might object that this effectively just equates to reducing the load by slowing down the user's connection, but that's not quite right; in this model the user still has reasonably fast access to the content they request so long as they request it, while in the 'slower connection' model the user gets slow access to everything. Essentially, constant connectivity is sacrificed here for speed and reducing network load. So no free unlimited multiplier gaming or video chats on the slopes of Kilimanjaro, but plenty of access to Reddit.\n\n**TL;DR:** There are plans like Google's [Project Loon](http://www.google.com/loon/#utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=Global_semBK) in development (and practice) to extend internet access to everywhere in the world. There are some good arguments for providing this internet access to users for free, but there is (at least) one very strong argument against this; that there is no reason for users to ever disconnect their internet-enabled devices, and that the network will therefore be under constant unreasonably heavy loads. My idea here is to provide a free mediated version of the internet through a Siri-like interpreter (while allowing unmediated internet access for a reasonable price on the side), allowing users to utilize the internet through the world-wide network for specific requests or actions rather than constant connectivity. This accomplishes the goal of providing essential connectivity everywhere in the world without the danger of over-use. It would essentially provide free access to specifically requested content at a reasonable speed, rather than providing unfettered internet access to content at much lower speeds.\n\n[*Disclaimer:* I haven't done significant in-depth research on all of the tech involved in these projects, and I'm no expert on networks - if I get something wrong here or if I'm fundamentally misunderstanding something I hope someone who knows better will correct me. Also, I know that programs like Project Loon are fairly [lofty](http://www.badum-tish.com/) ventures as it is, but lets assume for the sake of discussion that Google really does [get it off the ground](http://i.imgur.com/nDPJW.gif) and that worldwide internet access is plausible in this way.]",

And the driver could enter details about his XYZ car, it's this model, this much mileage.\n\nSo, passenger gets in, then gets out and GPS automatically detects that (we could also pair up the driver and passenger apps). \n\nNow comes the gas score. Each ride given, earns the driver some gas score which can be exchanged for, well, gas. (Clearly, the passenger must first have bought sufficient 'gas score' required for the ride length he's looking for)\n\nAn example. A normal 3 passenger,1 driver car.

Some people made some actually working products(drone, clock, microscope, 3D printer, wheelchair, robotic arm, Turing machine, ...) by using lego blocks(Main material were lego blocks. But usually added some other things). \n\nI read that 3D printer can make some household objects. One study approximately said 'Making household objects by 3D printer will save money for customers'.\nBut many products(including household objects) can also made of lego blocks. Their are many products in our house which are not used even once an year. What about replace these products with products made of lego blocks?\n\nIf my idea is adopted in real life, some manufacturing company will become lego block & instruction developing company. And I also have idea about a lego center which can borrow and store some lego blocks and construct products.\n\n\n* *Following sentences are some advantage and weakness of my ideas(lego block as a product material).\n* \n* Advantage : It is possible to reuse some lego blocks(It maybe reduce garbage. Hence, may eco-friendly. And It can be a great advantage for some spaces. For example : space station, developing countries, house which has no or little place to store products), May require relatively less energy, information(data), time to make some products than 3D printer, ... \n* \n* Weakness(Possibly fixable weakness) : Lego blocks have limitations to make some products(density, durability, size, materials, shape,...), Quality of products made by lego block is not good(or even dangerous to use), Actuator of lego is limited, ...\n* \n* Weakness(Maybe unfix-able weakness): Easy to hack products, It is possible to make weapons by using lego blocks, lego block can't make extremely detailed products(medical models, ...) or something(clothes, foods, microchips,...), ...\n\n\n\nI guess many weakness of lego can be fixed by developing new lego blocks or by adding some other things or by developing new instruction.\n\n**What do you think about my idea(lego block as a product material)? Does it just an unrealistic idea? Or not applicable as much I thought? This idea is already existed?**(After read the book 'Cloud Atlas'. I thought the idea of entire reincarnation. And planning to post SF,Religion version of stories. But, today I found that I am too late.)\n\n\nP.S : Of course, 'lego block' can be replaced by other things which have great compatibility.",

When you get to the end of the 50 (or something) pages, just flip it and the next 50 pages load from the beginning.\n\nFor this to be possible, we'll have to use that E-ink thingy that's specifically designed for eBooks and put into onto several double sided flexible screens which would have to become cheap for the whole thing to be commercially viable. [E-Ink](https://www.google.com/search?q=e+ink&gws_rd=ssl) needs very little power.. so perhaps we can slap on solar cell on one side (and a touch screen on the other)",

            "selftext": "So every town has big box stores that are sitting empty because no one has a business that fits. My idea is two parts:\n\n1. Sell converted cargo containers into housing units, but have them remain able to be placed on trailers for easy moving. They would also have standardized connections for utilities.\n\n2. Modify empty big box stores to allow for cargo containers to be provided with utilities inside of a secure, climate controlled area. \n\nSo if you are a mobile professional that tends to move from city to city after a year or you do 3-6 month contract jobs in cities around the country, the thing that is missed is a sense of home. Hotels get old and the idea of paying for rent while you're away is wasteful, so why not bring your house with you?\n\nYou buy a container and have it finished according to a menu of selections, or have it customized. Then when you have a new contract you simply call the trucking company and it's placed on a trailer and shipped to your new location. No packing, except to secure loose items. Then when it gets to the former big box store it's unloaded and then stacked into pre-positioned layouts to ensure that you have access to utility connections as well as stairwells for entry and exit. The containers would be stacked up to 3 high depending on interior space of building. The interior could have a simple grid setup or perhaps there would be a layout of various paths or tennis courts depending on how the owner builds it out.\n\n ",

It would have belt loops so that you can add a belt to further cover the sewn together aspect. \n\nIn order to remove the usually baggy backside, you'd have spandex in the material to give it more give. The reason for the difference from most coveralls is that in a heavier work environment the spandex mix just wouldn't hold up to the abuse, but in an office environment it works fine.  \n\nThis could actually be for anyone who works in an office and is sick of the their shirt becoming untucked or the tie flopping in the way.

In that thread, literally hundreds of people asked if they could donate.\n\nMy point is, nobody likes paying taxes because we don't know what goes where, how much ends up in some greedy politicians pockets. Don't get me wrong, I'm sure 99% goes to the right place. But the 1% is what receives all the attention.\n\nAgain, my point is, when people find out they that can directly help with something, whether it's that 10 year old girl, or colonizing Mars, they're gonna want to help.\n\nAccording to the infographic, Rosetta cost like 3.5 euro to each european. That is fucking ridiculous. What the hell are we still doing on earth? \n\nMore seriously, we need a non profit organisation- affiliated only to the people, no country- (I doubt americans would want to fund russian space programs and vice versa)... that gets it's funding from people all over the world and keeps track of where every single dollar donated by someone went. So, people can make an account, maybe get a donation subscription and look up where did their money go(e.g: \"Your $5 combined with others donations allowed us to research ion engine\" or something).

Bystander CPR has been shown time and time again to be the most important step in trying to save someone's life from sudden cardiac arrest. If people who know CPR (American Heart or Red Cross) have their location settings on, possibly the 911 call center could page out people who are within 1000 meters of the incident. Likewise, people could respond to page outs, \"check in\" if they are going, so the scene doesn't get overwhelmed with people (although more people doing CPR the better). This could reduce response times while EMS are on the way.  \n\nLikewise, the app could alert you where the closest registered AED is.\n\nFeedback? I don't know anything about creating apps, but I honestly think that this would be a very important initiative to help save lives and increase awareness/action surrounding cardiac arrest and CPR training.",
