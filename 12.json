            "selftext": "So we've all seen those LED billboards right; I think a fun and interesting variation of that would be increasing the pixel density and making every other LED an infrared LED (basically an IR blaster like the end of a TV remote) because of course, the infrared spectrum is not visible to the human eye, but phone cameras can pick it up. So using that on signs and billboards could make for some really interesting company-to-customer interaction by hiding messages, discount codes, secret menu items, or even just making a cool thing for brand awareness. People would go crazy trying to find the messages, and would post the fuck out of something like that on social media. Of course I'm sure this would have a lot of other cool potential uses, but LED billboards was the first practical sounding use I thought of. ",

Bank partnership and saving promotion among local leadership that displays the creation of an entire process efficiency with the detailed explanations and provable projections will increase banking institutes community involvement and promote a more promising future.\n\nCommunity membership and involvement will include a built in health institution investment designed to be stand alone to promote health check-ups with a health-care professional regional networking providing real world solutions to community specific health problems while complicating with a nationwide professional resource network to seek similar situations and respond intelligently.\n\nLocal Health Care providers would benefit from down to earth payment structure and regular cash influx without the headache of insurance/government billing.\n\nThe whole system works similarly to a Savings and Loan.  Without the saving.  Or the loaning. ",

I had a bunch of stuff so i payed him to store my stuff in his closet. \n\n\nI imagine there are probably a lot of people in my situation and his. This app would create a means for those people to find eachother. The storage user (user) would find a conveniently located storage provider (provider) using the app as well as the terms of use. Length of storage, option to cancel early, how often user can withdraw their possessions for use and what kinds of fees that would involve. \n\nThis could also be good for microbusinesses to house inventory. The app does a soft credit check and provides legal documents needed to ensure everything goes smoothly for everyone. Users who fail to pay, forfeit ownership of goods. Providers who fail to provide are fined (future app payments) or might even have some sort of lien put against them. In the case of fire or flood, either the renter's insurance covers it or it is a loss for the user. Small risk though. \n\n\n\nObviously this is for storing junk at affordable rates, not storing your valuables.\n\n\n",

What if you took out the rear-view mirror on a car and replaced it with a three part screen. The screen on the left would be connected to a camera housed in the front-left side of the car pointing back. The screen on the right would be connected to the camera on the right-side. Then the screen in the middle would be a wide-angle view of what's behind the car.\n\nThis would completely eliminate blind spots and you'd only need to shift your eyes for a moment to get a comprehensive view of what was around you, rather than turning your head.\n\nIf such a product already exists please let me know because I would like to purchase it.",

Jung we do know that the monotheistic god-name (Eternal, Yhwh) was containing the Future as a concept  Yes, this name partly exists also in he name of Ye-shuah (Jesus) - also a future tense form of a verb: meaning Will-Save (from death).\n\nYe is the prefix signaling future in verbs.\n\n\nSo I think we could inspire those believers or practicians  among the mmbers of  Abrahamic religions /which all retell the myths of Yhwh and also of Yeshua/ who genuinely wish or profess  to follow their own prescription of \"love the stranger\".\n\nNot doing anything, just maybe sorting out ourselves , to follow the \"sacrifice \" concept - namely to work in an abstinent way /not focusing on present possible extra joys / for a better future. \n\nAnd by calling ourselves Future Authors (at least the subreddit  could be named like that) we could experience the pitfalls of such a moniker or label.\n\nOnce there  existed such a subgroup - a few Arameic and Hebrew speaking tribes in Babylonia called themselves Yehodi (meaning Future-Thankers) and later they became the \"Jews\". And their reception was quite ambivalent: others used their concepts /both the Higher Power - El, Allah - and the Anointed Saviour - The Yeshuah Mashiah or Jesus Christ was at the center of huge movements that  posited themselves as the \"real Israel\" and the \"firstborn of Abraham\" as somehow better than the original group.\n\nSo if non-religious (or just tradition-respecting  people  would start a Future-Echoing group or subreddit (another translation of yehodi) this could eventually have a sobering effect on those who still are bitterly mistrustful towards each other (despite they all having the  prescription of \"love the stranger\").\n\nBut possibly it is just not possible to influence others in any way.\n\n",

I like the name Nightcrawler's Pizza. The building could be open from 9 PM to 5 AM. Delivery only and only open at night allows us to reach our market exclusively with no competition. It also allows us a lot higher budget than most pizza places would have. This would allow us to compensate workers for the working overnight. Higher pay would also entice more workers. Also with an increased budget we could focus on employee safety with body cams considering the danger of working overnight. What do you guys think of my crazy idea \n\n\nEdit: Grammar",

            "selftext": "There are an infinite number of ideas and facts  \nin the universe that one can pay attention to.  Likewise there is an infinite number of waves, keys and tempos in music that one can pay attention to.\n\nIt's impossible to give truthful attention to all of the ideas and facts of the universe, either because it would create too many contradictions internally or on the basis we as humans are too limited to understand these rules, and will fail.\n\nSo, I'm a musician (as a hobby) and I started to notice odd parallels between creating music, and a stable moral foundation.  What's the parallel?  A genuine morality requires structure, just like any song worth listening to. \n\n I found this interesting because many of my good friends believe that moral systems are relative to the person using them.  I don't share this belief for a few reasons.   Using the \"music of morality\" phylosophy I believe it's an evolutionary fact that a moral belief system requires a foundation and structure to survive.  Which rules out beliefs that don't impose any structure (atheism for instance) a belief with no structure is a band with no instruments or singers.  It's simply, not.\n\nEDIT: \n\nThanks for reading!  Love to hear thoughts.\n",

            "selftext": "I know it sounds weird, but hear me out.\n\nAt birth, all humans are given an implant- likely ocular similar to the Black Mirror Episode *Nosedive*. However, instead of a weird dystopian world with five-star reputation ratings, the implants can be tracked to determine someone's location. The implant would be linked with your phone, and a card, too.\n\n#Stats\n\nThe implants would likely be able to track your stats- everything from age and heart rate to your last meal and your academics. If paramedics/first aiders were required, they could use a device to scan the victim's stats, allowing them to instantly know what to do (i.e with a simple scan, the first aiders know their victim needs CPR).\n\nAs well, the implants might be able to detect certain types of mental health- like depression or anxiety issues, and contact a therapist or psychiatrist for additional support.\n\nThe implants might also be able to detect if you haven't had something vital to your systems in a long time- if it does, it sends a notification to your phone, or something visible. \"You have a Vitamin K deficiency\" or something like that. Doctors could also basically scan you in addition to check for any health problems that might arise in the future.\n\n#Economics\n\nSimilar to the Octopus Card in Hong Kong, you can be registered in certain places just by tapping your phone or ID card into a certain reader. This is already in Hong Kong- You can pay for McDonald's, transit fares, parking fees, even attendance in high schools. In this case, when someone pays for something, the fee is deducted from their bank account, as if the card were a credit card.\n\nIf someone manages to hack your account to withdraw money, a notification shows up asking if you withdrew X amount of dollars. The moment you say no, it's obviously fishy. (Probably a \"Are you sure\" thing in case someone taps no on accident)\n\n#Social Life\n\nThe person's ID card would likely be linked with their social media accounts- dating, facebook, twitter, instagram, etc. People might be able to view their friend's photos and status updates without using their phones, just like in *Nosedive*. \n\nFor dating/hookups, you can enter your interests and other things you put on a dating profile, and see who matches up with you based on your interests or personality type. ~~Hell, you could even match up on kinks.~~\n\nThe ocular implants can recognize people simply by looking at them. Ever had an awkward moment where you think a stranger was someone you recognize? Not anymore. The implant lists you with the name, interests and times you've seen them before, so you can even befriend someone you originally were going to have a bad time with.\n\n#Location?\n\nThe implants will be able to track your every move. Don't worry- you won't be recorded jacking off in the shower, but your location will be in the home bathroom. \n\nObviously this has setbacks, but missing persons case and murders can easily be solved- just find the location of the person at the time of the murder and all is good in the world.\n\n#Smart Home?\n\nThis is a bit of a stretch, but these implants could definitely connect to appliances like fridges and microwaves. Is your popcorn done? Notification. Last week's chili expired? Notification. It's also pretty good in telling you if something is burning in the oven.\n\nAs well, Black Mirror's *White Christmas* features a smart home that has a routine. You can set a song to wake up to, when the alarm goes, what breakfast you'll have, even warming floors and pulling the blinds up.\n\nTo-do lists and grocery shopping lists are also pretty good- reminders to buy milk and bread would definitely be useful, especially in conjunction with auto-updating lists when you're sharing the list with someone. When you buy something on the list, that thing gets crossed off both lists.\n\nThat's pretty much all the ideas I have. What do you think? Sound good?",

It's not that history itself is boring, it's just that they make murder and revolution sound about as interesting as a phone book the way it's presented in textbooks. This got me thinking- what if there was an ASOIAF-esque series of books, that retold history in an entertaining and engaging way? They would be as historically accurate as possible, but some things would obviously have to be made up (dialogue, personality, sometimes appearance), following any available guidelines that we have. Each volume would be told from the perspective of multiple characters, whoever is most significant at the time. All the literary elements employed in modern fantasy would be used, but in a way that makes sense for the context. I know I'm not the first to have an idea like this, but what do you think?",

I'm proposing an application for these farmers with the best practices to take care of their farm as well as information about how they can start earning from an alternative source. The thing is, I do not want it to be only an information app. Cuz, not every farmer has a smart phone.

Just keep a polygraph in between the two guest chairs, for politicians. Think of it, regardless of your political sway, every politician that walks on one of those shows gets tested as they lie... uh speak.\n\nAny host will very likely lose a bunch of political guests. True. However, I think this country will be a lot less messed up, in very little time, if any politician is subject to this test in front of millions of viewers. I also think the view count will grow significantly, even with the lack of guests... Assuming no one in power decides this isn't going to continue...\n\nAny thoughts?",

It encourages the children to learn, whilst being charitable (donating 10 grains of rice for each correct answer).\n\nIn terms of speed monitoring systems, it could be paid for through speed camera fines from other areas, and through the reduced number of accidents as a result of the system being in place.\n\n----\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nA speed monitoring system which uses ANPR to monitor drivers' average speeds, and donates a small amount of food to a charity if they stick to it.

A very good chance someone may press the button to accidentally disconnect. Hardware is unknown to me so, I do not know if consent use of removing it might cause problems in the future.

            "selftext": "Imagine if we could program virtual currency to do things automatically. If you look at money as fuel for the economy, then you could hypothetically use programmable currency to write a program that acts as a virtual engine/generator for the economy that's fueled by this virtual currency. At a large scale, it would keep spending high and keep incoming currency redistributed rapidly among all contributors, kind of like a participation-driven basic income. You take care of the machine today, it takes care of you plus some tomorrow, then when you're all good you come back and contribute again.\n \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHere's how it could be used to raise funds for a collective account while keeping money constantly flowing to contributors:\n \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nFor each deposit into the collective account, we split the funds between the collective account and the contributors. We'll call this \"Money-Share\". You get on the Money-Share list by contributing and you're removed once you make 5 times your contribution. To understand why this works, you have to consider what it means at a tiny scale and what it would mean to scale that up:\n \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSay you're the first to deposit and you put $200 in. Nobody is on the Money-Share list yet so the collective account gets the full $200. Then I come along and put $200 in as well. $100 goes to the collective ($300 total) and $100 goes to Money-Share. You're the only one on the list, so you get it all. Now let's say the next deposit comes in at $400. The collective account is at $500 and the remaining $200 is split between us, the only members on the Money-Share list. You've collected your initial contribution and I'm halfway there. Now a whale comes and deposits $4800. The collective grows to $2900 and the remaining $2400 Money-Share is split 3 ways ($800 each). You've now collected the max profit we allow ($1000 which is 500% of your initial deposit) and are removed from the Money-Share list. I don't know about you, but I'd be putting more money back in to stay on the Money-Share list.\n \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nEssentially we're creating a feedback loop: people are getting paid as long as money is moving through the system. Their profits will lead them to put in more money as well as encourage new people to contribute creating a chain reaction of new deposits from existing and new contributors. After peak growth, there would eventually be a reverse feedback loop: deposits inevitably slow, causing less people to put money back in, causing further slowing. This is where the collective account kicks in: we use it to pursue relatively safe ventures (like renewable energy farms) until there's enough profit fed into the system to maintain the feedback loop and achieve self-sufficiency.\n \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIf every contributor slightly reduces the risk for everyone else, then hypothetically there's a number of participating individuals/groups/businesses/nations that would make the risk basically zero. A never-ending whirling of currency that allows everyone to spend a little today to make a lot tomorrow.",

            "selftext": "I just had this idea, so thought of putting it out. The basic idea is simplicity itself, just another application of crowd-sourcing to another area of business. Typically, when you (as an individual or small householder) need a loan, you apply for credit at the bank, and bank lends it to you at a very hefty interest rate. In fact this is how banks work (for example):\n\n1. They borrow from the masses in form of savings or term-deposit accounts at say 4% interest (perhaps even lower in Europe!).\n2. They then lend that money to industrialists, government or the above householder in our example at much higher interest, say 14% (even higher in some countries).\n3. Profit on the interest differential (14-4 or 10% in this example).\n\nWhat if we create a lending/borrowing website on the Internet that bypasses the need for a bank (at least for our householder kind of people). Individual X on our platform can lend to Individual Y at specific interest rate. If individual Y defaults for some reason, their standing on the platform decreases (based on reviews, ratings, etc.). If they pay back, on the other hand, their reputation increases. No need of credit tracking agencies or banks to get involved. Similar to bit-torrent architecture, we can make it feasible to lend extremely small amounts (like $2), so an individual shouldn't face a big loss even in case a default happens!\n\nWe can even have one member of the community to visit and perform an audit (just visiting them and having a nice chat with tea, etc.) with another residing in same area and record such audits which will increase both their reps.\n\nLet me know how this idea sounds on a scale of cool to mediocre to laughable?",

I thought that opening a small gap on the window should help in the airflow, putting some windscreen shades etc would help but they dont. Even owning a white colored car also doesnt help.\nSo I have an idea where car manufacturer should install a solar panel on car roof to generate electricity to run the air conditioner in the car; while it was park under the hot sun. The idea is simple, we need cooler/air conditioner that keeps running even if the engine is shut; hence the solar panel will help in running the air conditioner.\nThoughts?",

This company allows people to use their dollars to vote for new tech that they want to see in the world (tech because it offers a specific market to target...could create separate, sister orgs that focus on science, art, etc...but tech is where I'd want to start)\n\nThis could be membership based: in addition to pledging dollars, where $1=1 vote, you pay $100 per year to be a part of this. When the voted-on product is released, it goes to members for no extra cost, besides the amount they pledged to vote (perhaps maxing votes at $100/person) and their $100 membership fee. Then it gets released to the public for at least $300.\n\nIf someone who is a member did not vote for the winning venture, then they will be asked if they want to move the dollars they pledged from the projects they voted on to the winning one. If not, I would refund their membership fee and pledged dollars. \n\nI would want to make the voting public, so even though people who aren't members will not get a say in what is produced they can be assured that there are not secret coalitions to use the money for something evil. The operations of this company would be 100% transparent.\n\nObviously cost structure is kind of difficult, as the more people that want to be a part of this, the cheaper membership could be, but I think it is a great way to bring business into the 21st century and offer consumers trust in a time when that is a scarce resource.",

            "selftext": "Full disclosure I got the idea from the TWIT Knowhow IR basics ([Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyaRm5dVUcY), [Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOKcodVplgk))\n\n\n**Problem:**\nThis actually solves 2 problems. \n\n1. You have lots of IR remotes in your house, you don't want to throw them away but they don't work with anything you own. \n\n2. You have a number of IR based devices, TV, Aircon, DVD player etc... and if you lose any of these remotes it could be a pain to find a replacement especially for older model devices or Chinese knock-off devices. \n\n\n**Solution**\n\nIR master: It looks like a sleek black box the size of a phone charger. With it you control basically any device which uses an IR remote with any IR remote you have in the house. Its basically an IR transceiver that maps any button on any IR remote to any function on almost any IR based device. You can repurpose old IR remotes to actually do stuff instead of collecting dust in your house.\n\n**How do you use it**\n\nYou basically program the IR Master to know what functions the IR remote understands and the functions the IR device you want to control understands. Then the IR Master does the rest. Programming is done using a simple GUI, its has a *learn mode* \nwhere you press the button on the remote you want to emulate, then press the button on the remote you want to use in its place, the device will map them both and when you press on the 'fake' remote, the IR master will emit the correct signal and the device should operate as if you used the original remote. \n\nSince we can use any remote for any purpose this also means you can use one remote for multiple devices, as long as you have enough buttons on the remote. \n\n\n**Models available**\n\nI am thinking of 2 models at the top of my head. \n\nThe first cheaper model has to connect to a PC (or Mac) and you have to download software for the PC to program the device. But one it learns all the key codes, you can unplug from the PC and use it as it, but it needs to connect to power. The software will already have a library of built in virtual remotes to choose from. I was also thinking of another model that doesn't need power from an outlet but uses instead a 9V battery, but not sure if there is a market for something like that. \n\nThe second more expensive model has a Wi-FI chip in it, so you control from any smartphone. You can use the smartphone to program other IR remotes *plus* use the smartphone directly to control the device. You will of course need the smartphone app to use it and you can create custom buttons in the interface. And just like the cheaper option there will already have a number of virtual remotes available, but all are completely customizable , including size of keys and icon/text.\n\nThe 2nd option will also support *mesh mode* which would allow you to use multiple IR masters in multiple rooms and control them via a single app or even multiple apps. \n\nJust an idea. \n\nedit: added mesh mode.\n",

I know other developers who do the same, whether it's to look good on a resume or portfolio or to just have a project and help someone.\n\nI'm considering making a platform where non-profits, social causes, or even businesses in need can apply to receive free pro bono web work. \n\nI haven't decided on how the platform application model will work, should business apply and be approved/denied. Should they just post their needs and have developers pick and choose which they want to do. \n\nShould the developers be open to the public or a curated team. Perhaps a github like repo where devs work on a project but in a managed environment.\n\nIs there a way to offer incentives to devs to persuade more to join the cause.\n\nThoughts?",

I don't know why no one else seems to talk about this (hard to believe I'm the only one who's thought of it), so I'll say it:\n\nIf we already have a system for regulating ownership and handling for cars, there's no reason we can't apply the same accountability and responsibility to guns and gun owners.\n\nCars are every bit as dangerous as guns - arguably more so , considering how many more people die to car accidents than gun violence per year. So naturally, we (society) take steps to mitigate the danger. Cars are regulated with safety standards; drivers are tested before they can be licensed; owners have to register their car, so we know who's driving what. All this bureaucracy, and no one bats an eye - because of course you need a license. A car is 2+ tons of steel and 20 gallons of explosive gas; you don't let people run wild with that without taking some kind of precaution. \n\nThe DMV, as a state body, works. Slowly, clumsily, and sometimes frustrating, but (eventually) it works - and it certainly works better than nothing at all. And from Sandy Hook to Orlando and now Las Vegas, it's clear that \"nothing at all\" is not enough anymore. No one's talking about knocking down doors and ripping guns out of baby's hands. We SHOULD be talking about normal, every-day Americans doing their part to reduce gun violence by working together - so that abnormal, NON-every-day \"Americans\" stand out, and then we can deal with them. Laws aren't there to put good people down (we're not that far gone); they're to draw a line beyond which we can say \"This is not okay.\"",

This is /u/1zock's idea with a few more details filled in by me. Here's the idea:\n\n**The Objective**\n\nTo take advantage of the incredible efficiency of the free market system to make prisons provide a better service to convicts and the public.\n\n**Why this hasn't Worked**\n\nThe system of incentives has been wrong. To the extent that we've experimented with private prisons (at least that I'm aware of) the prisons have been paid for the time they've spent interning the convicts, which has incentivized them to extend prisoners' terms (in manners that can be unjust and/or inhumane), and spend as little on rehabilitation as possible, possibly resulting in worse outcome for ex-convicts and society as a whole, including higher recidivism rates.\n\n**A Possible Solution**\n\nIncentivize private prisons to produce the best possible outcomes for ex-convicts and society as a whole by:\n\n* Only paying private prisons for the degree to which their ex-convicts live successful, productive lives, contributing to society, and penalizing them for each ex-convict who commits another serious crime.\n* Making prisons entirely responsible for the costs of housing and containing their prisoners, and responsible for deciding when it's appropriate to release each prisoner, so that they're incentivized to only imprison each convict for as long as they need to to be reasonably certain that that person won't commit another serious crime, and provide them with whatever (counseling, job training, business contacts, etc...) they need to be a contributing member of society.\n\n**Additional Possible Benefits from Such a System**\n\n* It's possible that such a system could lead to a huge boom psychological, sociological, and economic research into the causes of crime and how to address them, with private prisons eagerly funding that research and trying out new theories and practices as they're developed in order to find what works best and maximize their efficiency.\n* It's possible that such a system could result in gradual, indistinct endings to prison sentences becoming the norm, where prisoners are given increasing autonomy as they're reintegrated into society, and in many cases the prisons are still checking in on them and providing services for decades after they leave the prison grounds, to help ensure that they live successful lives.\n\n**Concerns that May Need to be Addressed**\n\n* A lack on consistency in how convicts are treated, the resources they're provided, and the lengths of their terms, which may be unfair.\n* The need to ensure that the people who are in charge of deciding when prisoners are released are insulated from any threats or our personal incentives that may affect their deciding.\n\nPerhaps both of these concerns could be addressed by having some sort of government liaison for each prison.\n\n____________________________________________\n\nSo what thoughts do you have? Is this a good idea? Are there are any ways you can see it could be improved? Are there any other concerns you can see that would need to be addressed, and what ideas do you have for addressing them?\n\nAlso, does anyone know if this idea is already out there in the criminal justice community, and if not, what might be some initial steps to make sure that the people who need to see it see it? Taking it further, what might be some initial steps make this a public issue, and be put public pressure where it's needed in order to make this proposal a reality?",

You could integrate it Into  kitchen appliances etc. But these would all just be screens without processing power themselves but they would all connect to this central system and that would be the computer and you could seamlessly transfer windows or games or anything from one screen to the next. For example your watching a YouTube video on TV and you wanna walk over to the kitchen or bathroom but don't wanna interrupt so you could use a system similar to Xbox kinect and do a hand gesture that swipes the video from the TV to the phone screen without having to load it onto the phone",

So it'd be like how they have 2 or 3 sets of ongoing stories where they play different characters in each rather than an actual standard format comedy sitcom.\n\nTitle probably doesnt make much sense if its set in Philly but maybe the gang goes to Portland instead and tries to open a bar.

I don't have a problem with most of these techniques, but in the back of my mind I'm always wondering whether I'm really seeing a raw recording of animals in the wild. \n\nFor example, BBC's Frozen Planet shot some of their polar bear footage with bears in a zoo. [(Source)](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/dec/12/frozen-planet-polar-bear-bbc) It's great footage, and I enjoyed it. But I wish they'd have told me that some of it was staged. The \"pure\" wild footage would have been that much more compelling if they had. ",

I asked a lot of people what they wished they knew when they started self teaching or learning something new, and the feedback was always that they wish they could tell the good resources from the ones that lead them astray, and that others were vital in letting them know about this. I wanted to make this same interaction scaleable, so I built LearnSearch! LearnSearch is still in its early, early infancy, and I'm going to continue to build out different feeds, comments, and other cool features. I'd love for you guys to take a look and let me know what you think! I'm proud that I could take an idea to execution in a short window like that, even though it is really really small right now.\n\nYou can check it out here: www.learnsearch.xyz, would love your feedback or feature requests!\n",

I always plug my headphones in and go straight to my thumbs up playlist, skip the first 20 songs until I find a track I've heard about 1000 times before. Maybe I'll put a Radiohead or Pink Floyd album on that I know back to front, but sometimes I want something new, and I want someone to take the decision out of my lazy hands.\n\nJust a daily album recommendation that could be based on the album's birthday; maybe it's a bands anniversary or it could just be an album that's suddenly gained popularity because one of the tracks was in Walking Dead last week. It's a great way to discover new bands or new or classic albums you might have missed out on.\n\nIt would just need to select the album each day, maybe have a link to Spotify/Google or Apple Music, and you can add some new music to your day.",

Subsidize them by bringing jobs directly to their home towns, and giving perks to the alternative energy companies?  If you shut down a coal plant but keep everyone in that town employed and teach them that they can be proud of what happened, that would be a win-win scenario.\n\nTake a look at coal miners, in particular: They make $14 to $29/hour (https://www.payscale.com/research/US/Job=Coal_Mine_Worker/Hourly_Rate) to put themselves in harms way for the sake of electricity.  Is there really no way that we can provide jobs for them manufacturing solar panels, windmills, etc?  And in the absence of that, could we not incentivize them by providing relocation for their families so that they can continue to earn the wage they are accustomed to, somewhere else?\n\nThese are just a couple of ideas, but I think it's a heck of a lot better than sitting on our hands and telling the working class, \"Sorry, it's 2017, you should have gone to college and I don't care about your plight\".

It\u2019s just the way we are, in fact there\u2019s an entire [NPR Article](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=121310977) on the subject. But aiming at seashell/fly decals is boring. Let\u2019s create new target! \n\nI\u2019m picturing something along the lines of those water gun games at the carnival, where you [shoot the stream of water into the clowns mouth](http://www.aardvarkamusements.com/images/thumbs2/big/clown-balloon-water-game-big.jpg) to be the first to pop the balloon at the top. Yeah you see where I\u2019m going with this.\n\nNow of course, unless we want to attach an air compressor to our toilet, we can\u2019t have our target blow up a balloon. I\u2019m thinking something a bit more practical but because Im no electrical engineer I\u2019m going to give a \u201cmaybe possible\u201d option, and an \u201centirely probable\u201d option.\n\n**\u201cEntirely probable\u201d**\nHere is the ideal Toilet Target. A 3\u201dx 3\u201d target, about .5\u201d thick. On the back there is a suction cup. Stick it to the back of a urinal/toilet. You now have a target in your toilet. Inside the target is a simple circuit connecting a battery pack to a single red LED sticking out the top of the target. In the center of the target there is a hole. When the...urination stream, enters the hole it depresses a switch which completes the internal circuit lighting the LED.\n\nBOOM! Now every time you go to the bathroom you have a target to shoot at with instant visual feedback if you hit it!\n\n**\u201dMaybe possible\u201d**\nOk so now we\u2019ve covered our basic target, but lightning an LED with your pee isn\u2019t all that exciting, we need to be more competitive. Introducing the Toilet Target Pro. Tak everything we said about the previous version, except this time swap out the red LED with a small digital count-up timer. Now when depress the switch in the center the clock begins counting up, pausing when you miss. When you\u2019re done you can see your score, NEW RECORD! To clear the score for the next user simply flush the toilet, the water streaming down the back of the target will trigger a different switch resetting the clock.\n\nShoot away!!",

The NFC chips could be paid for by buying into the service for a one time fee of $10 and then any stamp would be a stamp for you.  This could enhance checkpoints that show you where the package is as a sender or receiver.  You could also have some sort of p2p interface that allowed for personalized messages or alerts. Hopefully amid all of these revitalizations the USPS could make new rules that make junk mail too expensive to send out and reduce the amount of clutter while making mail more efficient.",

The name of the game is mainly evasion. Though you can kill, if necessary that is. And what I mean by this, is that the game would discourage the player from killing not just by the sheer force and size of, but by elevating the **humanity** in the insurgents you're dodging. \n\nThe game would also have some scripted sequences that show the brutality of war and the atrocities committed during war-time. The game would take place over the course of seven full days, with daytime being the most difficult to navigate in, not just because of the increased exposure, but because the bombing runs made by jets as a response to the failed siege.\n\nStarting inventory slots will be very limited, but can be expanded once backpacks or other bags are picked up and used. Carrying too much, however, can slow your character and make enough noise for the insurgents to hear, so it would be best to pick up items of the **highest** priority to the player in particular.\n\nAll in all, this is a game that I'd really like to see be made and to play.",

Then a headphone/line-out jack on the power adapter. ",

Like a place to get a chicken breast and some greens. It could be a nice alternative for students or young people to get a healthier meal than fast food.\n\nI even had some ideas to make it more appealing. \n\n* Offer a subscription service where you pay a flat rate each month and get a certain amount of meal pertaining to that amount.\n\n* A student discount. If you bring in a student ID you get meals discounted a certain amount.\n\n* To-go and advanced ordering. Like if you knew you were going to work Thursday until 8 p.m., you could preorder for that day and pick it up on your way home.\n\n* Maybe even something like a work for food program. If you don't have a lot of money for the rest of the month, you could work for an hour or so to pay for your meal so you don't go hungry.\n",

However, I could've made those pictures at any time. I was playing with the idea of creating a service where people can upload any evidence (e.g. pictures or videos) and that service would take care to create a credible proof that this evidence was in fact uploaded at that given date. So my question would be, do you find that useful? Does it exist already? What are good keywords to search for something like this. I didn't find anything yet.\n\nEDIT: https://poex.io/ does exactly what I intended to build.",

You report what candy you got at a certain house (also how much candy is left, if an unguarded bowl is there, if there is someone waiting to scare you, and other details.) and other kids and parents know where to go and can plan their trips accordingly. I feel like this should have been done by now if it hasn't already been done. This way you can see popular houses and skip houses that aren't worth going to. If I could program, I would have done it, but someone else can feel free to make this if they want. ;P",

It's a niche situation, but wouldn't it be an idea to give phones a quick access way to immediately notify police they should head straight to your location?\n\nThere are definitely situations where calling 911 isn't a good option, like a hostage threat or when you know an intruder is in your home. You have to call, actually speak, and say your location. This can take a while and give you away.\n\nBut nowadays we have the technology to send our location and a \"police, come here NOW\" signal with 1 press of a button. When someone wants to rob a bank, you can't exactly call 911. But if the robber knows that anyone could notify the police by just reaching their phone and tapping a single thing, it would, I think, deter a lot of crimes, as the threat of the police bein notified would be a lot higher.",

Basically what it does is triangulate the sound of gunshots and communicate that location to local police. Now imagine if this system were coupled with a team of maybe a dozen AI drones that could quickly be released. Using something like facial recognition software to identify the attacker, they would act much like an autonomous police helicopter, shining bright lights on the attacker and following pursuit. **This would not only disorient/blind/distract the attacker, but it would illuminate them for everyone in the area to see.** There's no doubt that a system like this would have been a tremendous help in the Las Vegas shooting for example, since the man was virtually impossible to see in his high-rise hotel room.\n\nCan anyone else think of improvements for this system? Pros/Cons?",

For example, the apps listed above that I was using for homework, could be tagged as \u201chomework\u201d. Before jumping at me, I know you can often create folders/collections of apps on your home screen/launchpad, but you might want to keep doc apps apart from emails, instead of creating a \u201chomework\u201d folder that contains both (keep in mind this means that your docs apps and email app are found here exclusively). Ideally, one could have an app, for example your email app, in more than one tag. If something like this does exist, please let me know. Thank you for reading. ",

            "selftext": "Essentially it would be a forum where people could log on to either debate, or to spectate. As the debaters discuss an issue, the spectators would grade each debater on their logical inconsistency and whether the facts they produce are credible. Debaters would be capable of reshaping what they say based off of current-time updates on what whether they are saying coincides with reason, and with the topic at hand.\n\nMost verbal debates rely on how well a debater is able to speak, and other online forums lack moderation, which means debates are able to derail more easily, and false facts have the ability to be propagated without scrutiny. Another issue with most forms of debate are the deviousness of responses. People who are capable of answering a question without answering flourish in most forms of media. This is a problem that can be solved by a moderated forum, because a debater would be unable to have a highly scored response if they do not directly answer a question, and would be required to resubmit until they directly and effectively answer.\n\nI am not sure how well this sort of forum would catch on in today's society; from what I have seen on many social media platforms, many people flock to the arguments that stray from fair, credible, and logical. To a lot of people, it is more fun to call someone a name rather than objectively evaluating another person's argument.",

            "selftext": "This idea went off when I was trying to buy bitcoin at $2000, but had to jump through many verification hoops over a month paying by a credit card before I could finally buy in at $5000. As a merchant myself I understand why this was necessary. Unfortunately I missed out on $3000 all because of my consumer protection/right of chargeback. Some sites don't accept direct deposit and credit cards are supposed to be convenient and quick, not take weeks of verification by a site to make sure you're real. Coinbase for instance imposes a $200 weekly limit before trust is built due to the fear of chargeback fraud.\n\nNow, as both a merchant myself and a consumer, I've seen chargebacks from both sides. Chargebacks are of course necessary to prevent fraud and dodgy products, but both genuine chargebacks and chargeback fraud (ie: the consumer themselves falsely claiming chargebacks for free items) is also very real and is the reason there are so many extensive document requirements by merchants when depositing money on their sites with a credit card. Other restrictions they're forced to impose are low maximum transfers/purchases etc in the event there is a chargeback. Merchants are at the very real risk of losing money (and do in fact lose money daily) due to chargebacks and thus require documentation that sometimes can take weeks to verify during periods of high activity and backlogs (such as the recent case in the cryptocurrency market boom). This can end up having a detrimental cost to the consumer such as in the case outlined above where deposits are needed to be made quickly but can't. All this for a protection we're supposed to have as a consumer. It shouldn't work like that where a protection can work against us.\n\nMy idea is this: Allow a form of purchase with credit cards with a checkbox that allows you to disclaim legal chargeback protection with your bank on a case-by-base basis.  By disclaiming your right to chargeback, the merchant may be more keen to do business with you quicker, and give you earlier access to higher deposits/transfers/purchases. This is both beneficial for the consumer, and the merchant.\n\nNow the very real problem here of course that you're wondering is what is to stop someone committing real fraud from using the waiver? Quite simply, when waiving chargeback protection in an order form, you will be redirected to your bank temporarily where you will be required to answer some questions before the waiver is granted. This will include entering your online banking password, a unique PIN (different to online banking password, this PIN is reserved purely for chargeback protection waiver), along with date of birth and a challenge question. Also, if the bank isn't convinced the waiver is safe, then it may be optionally denied by the bank.\n\nWhilst criminals may get access to a targets DoB and challenge question/answer, the onus of securing the chargeback waiver PIN will lay purely with the consumer, and they will sign an opt-in form to this system realizing that if their PIN is stolen, then they will accept the monetary consequences, not the bank, merchant, or anyone else. Again, this is an opt-in only system requiring a form to be signed by the consumer acknowledging such before this option even becomes available.\n\nNow the other problem you're all thinking is this: it's not legal to do this since government mandates consumer protection and requires banks to refund fraudulent purchases, defeating the entire purpose here. This is overcome by some form of lobbying by consumers insisting that they be allowed to bypass chargeback protection if they opt-in for this ability. This will be a purely \"OPT IN\" only system, and not in any way be a default option for credit card consumers. It will only be for people who need to make quick large deposits/purchases using a credit card, and voluntarily wish to waive their chargeback rights (to make life easier for the merchant) in exchange for the expectation that the merchant will treat them as a less risky customer.\n\nI can't see why this idea would be bad, as it gives more rights to consumers who opt-in to the system and understand the risks, to make transacting with merchants easier when needed (and on a case-by-case basis). Again, this wouldn't be a permanent waiver to all chargebacks, only for purchases where the chargeback waiver PIN has been entered.\n\n",

The site could further specify by country which would make it harder for anyone to try to break into it (and potentially block countries in the event of a major hacking attempt), as well as a lock out if the information given is wrong X times.\n\n\nThe customer just has to go into their bank account, look at the transaction, get the hash and the key, go to the company's website, and put it in to view the full receipt. Since the company has no access to personal information and doesn't log anything (no accounts or what have you), then all of the security relies on the banks and credit card merchants like it already does.\n\nhttps://www.mindmeister.com/974202364",

A base sends out a radio signal, it collides with an object and is reflected back, and the base identifies the object based on the properties of the return signal. We could have a remote control that has some element inside it for each button that can generate a unique waveform when hit by some electromagnetic wave. These elements would also be surrounded by an electromagnetic shield that will prevent the element from returning a signal unless, a button is pushed that lowers the shielding causing the em wave from the base station to interact with it and causing the element to reflect a signal back to the base station. The station then deciphers which button was pushed based on the waveform that it received. My knowledge of physics is not that great. I hope someone with more knowledge on the subject can enlighten me if this would work. ",

            "selftext": "Last year, PBS launched a free-over-the-air substation for PBS Kids. Parents fearful of childrens' exposure to advertising lauded the move and it also allowed for low income families to receive quality childrens' programming 24/7. Likewise, I've recently discovered noncommercial music radio, which has allowed me to expand my music horizons beyond the tired old music that corporate stations put out because it's what's profitable.\n\nI feel like a similar approach could work for news. Americans across all political spectrums are fed up with the combative, \"if it bleeds, it leads\" nature of commercial news, including many journalists. My proposal is to provide additional funding to allow PBS to set up free-over-the-air news stations: national and local. Its noncommercial approach will allow it to focus on producing quality news programming instead of broadcasting violent images to increase viewership, and therefore ad revenue. Finding journalists to staff this network won't be hard either, since I'd imagine that many of them are hungry for editorial freedom that the corporate overlords don't allow them. Finally, this approach will increase information available to low-income families, and its noncommercial approach will allow these stations to focus more on groups that the mainstream media has historically marginalized: the poor, the diverse, and women. \n\nIf we can find enough people in this country who care about NPR and PBS to fund these stations, we could certainly say the same about quality news programming, now more than ever.\n\nEDIT: Grammar",

Creative people are allowed to create even if their efforts to push boundaries would be considered too risky by the big companies they would otherwise be working for. People who would traditionally do volunteer work on the side can do it full time.\n\nSince this isn't already the standard, I'm assuming there's a major downside besides the obvious \"too much effort\", and that seems odd when also considering how much effort is probably being wasted by people settling for a job they don't care about (and always do the bare minimum work for).",

What if we used CRISPR to make worms that didn't reproduce, and didn't damage the intestine, and came out with the rest of the feces when they died after a year or so, but they still ate tons of food from your intestine? Anyone with a weight worm in them would effectively be burning an extra few hundred kcal a day! Double up and you could halve your weight with no effort!

(That is, the user will click 'up/down' then be presented with a second question asking them to classify the vote as eg feelings/reasoning ... or whatever classification/language we'd decide to use)\n\nSubreddits can then choose how they weigh eg emotional votes vs rational ones when scoring/ranking a post/comment. For example /r/science might weigh reasoning over emotional, but /r/awww or /r/the_donald might prefer to rank emotional over reasoning.\n\nAn additional step in the voting might also slightly deter more impulsive votes.\n\nEdit: clarification",

This would be like a net to catch food that was about to hit the floor.\n\nNot sure how to easily attach (magnets?) and then also keeping the fridge sealed still.\n\n[Look ma!

            "selftext": "I am looking for freedback(tm). (by term for free feedback)\n\nEver since the snowden leaks, everyone know now a days, there is so much information about you online, between facebook, google, and less friendly government programs, anything you've done, and everywhere you've been, already being known by a machine somewhere -- it's simply a fact of life! Welcome to modern age!\n\nThat's why my new company has finally decided to put that information to work **for you!**, hey, someone is going to have it anyways, might as well put it to work? The application is a mobile app called Life Tailor, and it's sole purpose is to be a one-stop all-in-one assistant to you!\n\nWhile other companies will use your information to try and sell you ads on the sly, our company instead is forthcoming an honest with what we collect. Here is how it works:\n\n**SETUP:**\n\nWhen you install the app for the first time you will link as many accounts as you can, granting permission to gmail, facebook, twitters, bank account, paypal etc. If you do not link an app at the time of install, don't worry, we will push you a notification when we find a new account you own and you can link it at that time. (you will find how we do it below in the \"collection\" phase) depending on your preferences it can even be linked automatically with no user input, if password is viable to our servers.\n\n**COLLECTION**\n\nThen, the application will scan your accounts, and local phone data. Texts, call logs, voicemails (where applicable), e-mail, facebook posts, twitter posts, browser history, battery log, music, podcasts, images (with reverse image search using google or tineye API to identity content of all images and tag it) etc. etc. It will learn everything about you it can. Additonally, the application may access your microphone, camera, and location at all times. it will know where you've been and what you said.\n\nNow, using the same tech that companies like Wal-Mart, Target, and etc. use we will understand and identify your purchase history, interests, desires, hobbys, etc. We will build a personal profile on you, discover how you feel about things (are you negative towards bamboo, or positive, for example. if bamboo is mentioned anywhere in your history, we will know if you like it, and we can use that information. don't like bamboo? no bamboo products will be purchased on your behalf. More on automatic purchases later)\n\n**PUTTING THE DATA TO WORK**\n\nAt this point you are probably thinking \"this is nothing new, you're just going to do targeted ads now!\" but not at all! That is the furthest thing from what we are doing! The magic is all in the \"modules\" you purchase. Each module has a subscription fee, lets say for example, you want to use Life Tailor\u2122 to make your food choices for you, no problem at all, based on your purchase, conversation, and location history, Life Tailor\u2122 will lean your needs, are you overweight? Trying to cut back? No problem. Life Tailor\u2122 will create a meal plan for your month, add all the items you need to your shopping cart, and purchase and ship all them to your house, it will pull the tracking numbers and push you a notification when the items are to arrive, and let you know if you won't be home during those hours (based on location patterns and location history), it can even call the carrier and reschedule a delivery. (I have experience in the shipping industry and it is easy to automate shipment requests with a corporate account) All automatic. This is just one example of the many services we plan to offer. \n\nA second example, if I may, is the bill pay service. Once you've given Life Tailor\u2122 access to all your financial records and banking information, as well as electric, cable, water, phone, and whatever other bills you may have, it will go to work analyzing your income versus your out going cash, never again will bills be late, or will you overspend! Life Tailor\u2122 will not allow you to spend any money you can't afford to! Let's say you want to buy a pizza, but Life Tailor\u2122 see that your phone bill is due tomorrow, and buying that pizza will mean your account will be a couple dollars short of that bill, you know that the phone company doesn't mind you being a week late, but Life Tailor\u2122 is here to make sure you make the **RIGHT CHOICE.** It will move all money you need for bills to a separate account, blocking access to them so you can't impulsively blow it on that pizza!\n\nAnd a third, lets say that Life Tailor\u2122 based on average mph movement finds that you are walking to work often, and sees that your efficiency and free time could be improved with the purchase of a taxi service on certain key days, the Life Tailor\u2122 app will automatically analyze trends in pricing for your area, and when it feels the time is right, you will be pushed a notification saying \"don't bother walking today, an uber is on it's way!\"\n\n**AUTOMATIC PURCHASING\u2021**\n\nAs mentioned above, Life Tailor\u2122 will have complete spending power, freeing you from worrying about how much money you have, or what bills to pay, an added bonus to this is that Life Tailor\u2122 will also be able to automatically purchase things on your behalf, as in the example above, food, and beyond that, things like movies, music, video games, books, whatever Life Tailor\u2122 thinks you like! Not to mention you'll never have to worry about re-upping your subscription to the Life Tailor\u2122 modules! While other companies are happy with just \"suggesting\" you buy things based on your profile, Life Tailor\u2122 puts your money where it's data is, and sends items directly to your home. Did you express interest in purchasing some new shoes in a conversation with your friend last week? What a nice surprise to see them arrive at your door! Free yourself from the hassles of life, let Life Tailor\u2122 take care of you. Take care of your family, take care of your home, your pets, your life. We know more about you than you think we could!\n\n\u2021^(Physical Contractual Signatures will be required to enable this feature. You will be mailed one automatically during first time setup, and the app will push you notifications reminding you to sign and return it.)\n\n\n**RELATIONSHIPS AND THE HUMAN WEB**\n\nOne of the most important features we will develop is the ability to understand how you, and that friend you're texting, relate to each other. What are your shared interests? When do you both sleep? When are you awake, or at work? When do you hang out? Life Tailor\u2122, having access to your social media accounts, will occasionally make posts promoting how great the service is, for example, lets say we just sent you a new jacket that you were looking at in the store the other day, we will then make a facebook update saying \"Just got this great jacket! Thanks Life Tailor\u2122 for the amazing gift!\", in this way we hope to encourage your friends to sign up as well, because once you and your friend both get the application, that's when the REAL fun starts! Having a 2 way understanding of the dynamic means we can begin to plan events for you! You and your friends all at home on a friday night? **\"Notification!: an uber is outside, you're going drinking with [FRIEND], [FRIEND], and [FRIEND]. Don't worry, we didn't invite [EX-FRIEND], we know you are having a fight!\"**\n\nImagine a world where you didn't have to buy your friend a gift, we know what they want, we know it's their birthday, and we know they're your friend, we automatically debit your account, buy exactly what they want, and ship it to them. **NO THOUGHT REQUIRED!**, moreover we can have a cake delivered, and taxi everyone to the party. Life Tailor\u2122 will even tell you when to start getting ready.\n\n**MISC SERVICES**\n\nWhat I've talked about here are only very small very specific examples, here are some other things that Life Tailor\u2122 can easily do for you:\n\n&gt;Schedule a haircut\n\n&gt;Send a mother's day gift\n\n&gt;Schedule doctor's appointments\n\n&gt;Sort your mail and automatically reply\n\n&gt;Begin playing a movie when you get home for the night\n\n&gt;Disable your lights and TV when you've stayed up past your bedtime.\n\n&gt;Call your boss and let him know you're going to be late (location based)\n\n&gt;donating to causes we've come to understand you care about\n\n&gt;Make twitter, facebook, and etc posts about news that you've commented on with your friends, either in text, or in person! Maybe you left the theater saying \"I didn't like that new movie\", we'll tweet it automatically, **NO INPUT REQUIRED!!**\n\n**HOW COULD WE POSSIBLY MAKE THIS WORK?**\n\nThe best part is that this technology is not only already on the market, but it's tested and proven, little to no development will be required, as most if not all of this tech can be licensed from google, amazon, apple, and etc. All we really need to build is the infrastructure and partnerships with companies to expand our modules and capabilities. One day, with the support of users, we will be able to completely automate your life, the stress of making choices will be a thing of the past, it's a bright future, and it's time to put it to work. \n\nThere will be many nay-sayers that think that this can not be done. But it can, it is only a few steps forward! Google already tracks your every move, pull up a location on your maps app you were at a week ago, and look at that! \"visited a week ago\"! But companies like google are so greedy with this information! they don't put it to work **FOR YOU!**, with the income from module subscriptions, our overhead and development costs will be easily met, this is not a pie in the sky dream, this is a very real concept that can be brought to the market in as little as 3 years. \n\nPlease let me know what you think.",

So my idea is that instead of having only one president why not have a council of leadership, in the council of leadership will be voted in by a STV system of voting and when elected they thyself elect who are going to do in council. In that council sits the head of head, the leader for diplomacy, military, administration and speaker of the house. Is this a good idea or not, any thought?",

I can't possibly visit all of them but when I hear of one that I'm particularly interested in I'd like to \"drop a pin\" or something on Google maps. (While at the office or while I'm thinking of it) Then, when I'm within a certain distance of said pin, I'd like a notification to pop up on my phone to remind me, \"hey you might want to go check this place out because right now you are close to it\". \n\nBonus points if it takes current traffic conditions into account. \n\nIdeally businesses could opt to have this \"service\" with Google and while looking at their website I can have the option to add it to my desired places....\n\nI would use the heck out of this service. \n\n(Just thinking about Google's new wait-time feature - what if you integrated this with that so Google could suggest nearby restaurants with shorter wait times)? \n\nDoes something like this exist and I'm missing it?  Any Ideas?  Any App developers want to take a stab at it? Throw my username in the credits somewhere and we have a deal.  If we ever meet - buy me a beer and I'll toast your success.   I'm kind of hoping someone at Google monitors this sub.  If that's the case and this idea works - I'm part of Google Rewards program and a local guide :)  (All kidding aside, as a consumer I'm literally asking you for better targeted advertising timed-based-on-location so that I'm more likely to give businesses money.

I used a notebook to keep track of stupid ideas, but most of them never came to fruition. Every idea is like a seed. You need to plant it, water it, and love it. Eventually, the seed is gonna sprout, grow into a plant and hopefully a tree.\n  I am in the process of building a platform to keep track of side project ideas https://www.producthunt.com/upcoming/seed\n  Do you think there is a market for this?

Alot of people don't vote because they feel like their votes don't matter.\n\nSo I thought, mabye an organization could be made with an aim at increasing political participation both in knowledge but also in votes. The organization would hold no stances but would talk about issues internally. The goal of the organization for its members is to take surveys and then vote for whatever is most popular. This isn't because it is right or wrong, but because the goal is to have things passed. It seems like a lot of the reason for demotivation politically is because nothing ever gets done. Loads of red tape and demonization of the \"liberals\" and \"conservatives.\"\n\nWas hoping that by voting for whatever is most popular the organization would ensure people feel their votes power which would then encourage them to put more effort into developing their opinions and social awareness.\n\nCould be complete crapshoot, but tell me what you think reddit!",

            "selftext": "I posted on my other account. Did I get shadow banned? What the heck??\n\nMoving on to the idea.\n\nI've tried dating websites in the past and they don't work for me. I have certain types of interests/values and I have to scroll through many profiles to find someone decent.\n\nI like OK Cupid's style of questioning and matching based on percentage but I feel most of the questions are not useful.\n\nSo, what about a dating website where there is no pictures. You only get one match at a time. You can only view other matches once you skip your current one.\n\nAlso, opposites don't attract. For a relationship to be successful, you must share the same values in certain areas.\n\nSo first, you filter out everyone that don't have the same answers to the core questions. The core questions are so far:\n\nDo you think flirting with others is okay in a relationship?\nDo you want children?\nDo you care about intimacy?\nDo you have/are okay with sexual kinks?\nWhat religion are you?\nWhat political affiliation do you have?\nDo you believe in spending wisely?\nHow much time do you want to be around partner:\nDo you have entrepreneurship ideas/ambitions?\nDo you have conscious bias towards ethnicities for dating?\nWeed/Smoking?\nAttentative relationship?\nCaring relationship?\nDo you value communication both ways in a relationship?\nWhat gender orientation does the other person have?\nAnd then, it gets to the interests questions. You are given a list of questions, with answers \"Not really\", \"a bit\", \"moderately\", \"a lot\". The answers have a value from 1-4. The difference in the values get subtracted from the match score for every person. For each question, you have an option to set its importance. So if the question is, \"do you believe in evolution\", and someone answers no (1) and you answer a lot (4), you can set the importance to 10. And then the difference 3 gets multiplied by 10 and becomes 30 points deducted from the match score.\n\nAnd finally, you have wants. Do you want to be organized, do you want to be athletic. It's the same thing as the interests. You can set which one is important to you.",

If we can get a few thousand subscribers on this sub we will begin the lottery.\n\nThis is up for debate still, but so far the rules will go something like this:\n\nEvery month we pick a winner who maintains their winning status for six months. This means that shortly after this lottery begins we will maintain six winners at all times, every month one new winner will be introduced and the one who has been there for six months will drop out.\n\nAfter every lottery the people who participated will be encouraged to give a dollar to any one of the people who are winners at the present time. They may give money to either one, or divided amongst everyone in anyway they wish.\n\nThe winners will be encouraged to share their stories and let us know how they will, and or are, spending their winnings.\n\nOne of the first questions that we'll be asking the winners is if they can show evidence of their payments too winners from the past. Answering questions or participating with information is entirely voluntary, it does not disqualify them from being a winner for six months. It's up to the participants as to who they give their money to.\n\nEveryone gets to judge and the variables are unpredictable, and the drama will be entertaining we hope.\n\nSo join the sub and we can make this happen.\n\n\n",

            "selftext": "Dear Docs of Reddit (and researchers, and public) - I want to share an idea that I have been tinkering with (in my mind) for the last couple of years. I would love your encouragement, constructive criticism, or other feedback!\n\nAn issue is that we don't have great data on outcomes, or an effective means to share it. This 2-minute (youtube) clip talks about it, and this is what my idea would address: http://bit.ly/2B1SfQW\n\nVision: A site that is FREELY accessible to doctors, and is updated by doctors - around the world. These \"cases\" will be without patient identifiers, but include details relevant to other doctors. Treatments change by geography, over time, and by demographic factors - so these will be included. Once there are a sufficient # of cases for a condition and treatment - statistical metrics (that are useful to most clinicians) will be automatically generated and displayed and compared to other treatments, etc. I want the site to dynamically record what is actually working or not across the world, so clinicians and researchers can improve upon healthcare delivery and perhaps cost (the cost angle, I've not really worked out yet).\n\nI want the site to be a non-profit (similar to Wikipedia). Edit access will be limited to docs. There are powerful vested interests that will want to push some drug or intervention or device - so limiting edit access to docs should mitigate that (but will not eliminate it). The site will be forever free to clinicians &amp; researchers, and public - funded through donations like Wikipedia. Over time should become a very powerful data source of statistics outcomes, searchable by condition, region, time, etc. No advertisements and aggregate data will be sold. There are many, many people and companies who would want to make money off of something like this. If Wikipedia can tell all such interests to suck it, I can too. I'll add more details below as comments come in. What do you think?",

But the pinnacle of the best things about Facebook, in that this social media website is only accessed through a self identification process of identifying oneself as a hero. We will ask a reasonable number of multiple choice questions, or agree disagree statements to allow the new hero to embark on their adventure of joining the very first superhero alliance. \n\nThey identify what type of hero they are, be it a guardian? A father? A protector? A loner hero? A leader? A mentor? A diplomat? An engineer? Afterwards they gain access to almost the full website. More on that at the end. \n\nThe list of hero subclasses could be practically endless, or more practical towards uniting towards a common goal which would be peace. \n\nWe could organize meet ups in the real world, fundamentally altered from other meetup groups because there will be a vetting process for each hero as well. \n\nThis could be based on their individual answers to tough questions and scenarios\u2026. We could present users with daily objectives in the form of scenarios they have to figure out to get karma, or something similar. Level up points, for their social media\u2026 \n\nSome social media sites like Reddit put a large emphasis on their power users, which for our website would be an amazing and integral part of the experience. For those that get to the top levels they have worked together either online or in real life to have a tangible effect on achieving peace. This website would have all the best elements of an MMORPG combined with those of a social media site. They would be able to access parts of the site that would be unlocked as they progress, which would lead to direct access to the most secret group of all, which I will be a part of as well as the other founding members. They would be part of the first Superhero Alliance on Planet Earth. \n\nThe second that secret is unlocked it would be easily given away. Perhaps I\u2019ll edit this later to further hide the secret, but to get this started I must first gather that Superhero Alliance and make this website happen. \n\n\nSo I ask you this\u2026 are you ready to be a Superhero? Think you got what it takes to be one? And most importantly, are you willing to pledge guardianship of the good on this planet and throughout the cosmos? Then take a step forward and PM me or comment here, and either lead, follow or GTFO of the way. \n",

But I'm lazy and never been courageous enough to study. So, no really high salary job soon. \nBut I had an idea, and I would know reddit opinion about it : its cons, limits, if there is already something similar, if there are more efficient ways to do the same kind of stuff and so on.\n\nHere is the idea : to create an association with some friends and people who would join the association : we would put some money aside each year and every X years we could travel to a country and bring supplies and some technology / knowledges to help populations being able to live better sustainably. We could also give classes about useful stuff etc. \nWhat do you think about it ? A waste of time and money because we could give the money to a bigger association ? A good idea ? A limited idea ? \n\nThank you.",

When it's green, it'll send your position to a server which will be displayed on a map for anyone nearby to see. And the indication is that you're open to a chat with whoever. Obviously, there are enormous security concerns implied there, so I've thought of a few options that might help.\n\n* You have to have a profile photo so you can see who the green dot is, thus identifying them.\n* Only people within a very small radius appear, say 10-50 metres. This way, you can't really use the app to lure anyone that isn't already very nearby or something.\n* When you come in proximity of someones green dot, there's an exchange on the backend (hidden/inaccessible to users) that records some identifying information about both users to the server. That way, all 'encounters' are recorded for safety/traceability.\n* A notification sits on your notification bar while the app is running and your switch is on, and it automatically turns itself off if you don't check back on the app in an hour or two. (By default, you can have it stay on permanently as an option).\n\nBut enough being grim, why could this app be a *good* idea?\n\nI hear quite often that young people have trouble making friends, it seems as though any potential catalyst for opening a conversation could be potentially very welcome. I'm debating internally if it's a good idea for the app to display -any- information about who the green dot on the map is or not, because I think there's a lot to be gained by talking to people you wouldn't normally talk to. Echo-chambering is a real problem when you can surround yourself with the exact community you want online, so this could be the real spanner-in-the-gears that is needed.\n\nThoughts? Opinions? Would you use an app like that? What would you have it do/not do?",

            "selftext": "Life Jackets. Now I know life jackets are helpful, and life saving.\nBut I was just watching the news where a guy had a rough go while on his 20km race, when 11kms in he was washed from his kayak by a large wave. No one was around and his leg rope snapped, he reached for the flare, the cord pulled but nothing happened. He wore a bright orange life jacket with a orange cap, lucky for this man a submarine was heading out and a crew member saw him, rescued by a submarine!\n\nThe thing about the story is that after all the safety gear failed this man would have been hard to find with the waves the way they were and him being ealderly he said \"I don't think I would have been able to last much longer\" It got me thinking, why not make someone easier to find.\n\nMy idea.\nWhy not put an inflatable balloon in the back of a life jacket? With a string or strong light weight rope attached, the balloon could be self inflating and a bright colour or some sort of material that allows it to be easily spotted. A beacon could also be attached to this. I know the drag from the wind would be a factor, but at the same time the person could hold the rope to stay above water so if they got tired of treading water they could just hold on to the balloon to keep above the water. \nThe balloon could have a light attached for night that shines inward so the balloon would be bright or look like a disco ball so it's be easier to spot.\n\nNot sure if this is a thing or not I just had an idea.",

BUT what if we were to create that foundation. call it a network of VR developers all working on one project if you will. if we were to create a seed/base world which is open....anyone would be able to work on it or pitch in and it would be impossible to hack seeing as anyone can see the code...think of a linux os for example. this is only a base idea but i thought that its interesting.

Subreddits - You can select which subreddits to view in your auto-browse, or view all that you subscribe to, or popular, etc.\n\n#####2.) Each post type could be checked on or off to be shown in the auto-browse.\n\n- Images - On/Off\n\n- Videos - On/Off\n\n- Text Posts - On/Off\n\n- Offsite Links (non-multimedia like articles, blogs, etc.) - On/Off\n\n#####3.) Set the time length by post type.\n\n- Images would show for ___ seconds.\n\n- GIFs would play ___ loops.\n\n- Videos would play for ___ seconds or full time of video.\n\n- Text Posts to show for ___ seconds per 100 words. This would also set the scroll speed of the browser.\n\n- etc.\n\n#####4.) Open link + Comments - Yes/No - Set comment time limit and scroll speed.\n\nThis would be integrated with RES (Reddit Enhancement Suite) so you wouldn't have to open unnecessary pages. Images, Video, etc. would be opened on the main page just like you would when browsing with RES.\n\n---\n\n#####Additional applications:\n\n*Auto-Scroll Reader* \n\n- This same tech could auto-browse news articles for an example. First starting with popular news sites and tune in on the scroll speed vs words per minute based on the articles body text word count.\n\n*Read Time*\n\n- Set your words per minute reading speed and the browser will have a clickable icon in the menu bar that users can click, it will show a small bubble with the apx. time it will take you to read the article.\n\n---\n\nUnless some of these tools already exist, let me know because it would be handy.\n\nIf not, who wants to help get this off the ground?\n\nI do graphic + web design so I know a bit of stuff, and would need help programming.",

I don't know how difficult it is to make a USB receipt printer actually work as an OS printer on that machine... (as opposed to using that specific receipt-printing-language). But once that is done, it would be really cool to also have a web server with some functionality on that box. \n\nThen every machine in the house could go to the web page of the server, there would just be like a simple text box on the page. You'd type or paste in whatever notes you had, press a button on the web page and hey presto, the receipt printer prints it out and the text box is cleared.\n\nWhat do you think?",

            "selftext": "So basically I want to change a law. I would like to make campaign contributions in any form totally illegal. This post is a test to see if my way of doing it would be possible. As it stands, Americans as individuals have virtually zero political influence. For example, republican or democrat, nobody in their right mind wants campaign contributions to exist but they still do. This pisses me off. So here is my plan and its totally based on popularity of the idea. Basically we need to get organized and shut down the economy. Just like when the politicians can't get along and they shut down the government. Lets use it against them and mean it. Occupy wall street was a great idea, but all those 1 percenters just sat up in their towers looking down. It had no teeth. So I propose that if this post were to be upvoted to the front page we would have an idea of wether it would be popular enough to go viral in other places. Like Facebook. If it does we can get together, create a website, generate some buzz make the news and set a national strike date. I am thinking next year on black friday to really make it count. It can be calling in sick for work  or refusing to do anything that would stimulate the economy. Like not buying anything. We go as long as we can. Not everyone needs to participate for it to be effective. I feel like enough people are angry on both sides of the aisle for this to work. If for some crazy reason it did work, we could regain the collective power of the American people and use it to solve other issues. Let me know what you think.

Like close my Facebook down etc because I'm sure my relatives don't want to have to be reminded of me after I'm gone.\n\nSo what if there is a website that knows all you're online accounts(that doesn't sound right, open for suggestions!) And after you die, a designated person or people are sent the details with some instructions or just a note from the the person who has passed. \n\nThat way all your online presence can be squared away by a trusted person or group.",

The amount you pay is based on how much debt you have, and how much money you earn, but it's going to be a low amount. Ideally, it would never go higher than $100 per month. \n\nBut here's the cool part: each month a lottery is held with the money collected, and one of the members of the Union has all of their debt paid off. If more money is collected in that month than the lottery winner has debt, it will rollover into the next month, indefinitely.\n\nNow this is the naive part but it is a fantasy, so sue me: It will be 100% non-profit. The only money collected from member dues that doesn't go towards the group's debt will be for server maintenance and staff. \n\nIf you miss payments, you don't get kicked out, but you lose your chance to win the lottery that month. This is important, because many people (like myself) have a hard time hitting all of their payments each month, but that's the whole point of the union; to be able to get out of that hole. It's also how the reserve will \"catch up\" with itself, by replenishing money with the dues from non-eligible lottery members.\n\nHere's the part I haven't figured out: how to penalize members who have already won the lottery, but are missing their payments.\n\nSo what does everyone think?

Also while we are at it, make a version of those ornaments instead of be suppression ball, be a smoke detector?\n\nChristmas tree fires destroy a large number of homes every year (something like 200 in the US, annually), I can see this product making a huge difference. ([Unofficial looking website that contains statistics that I did nothing to verify](http://www.nfpa.org/Public-Education/By-topic/Seasonal-fires/Winter-holiday-safety/Christmas-tree-fires))\n\nBecause the contents are pretty chemically inert, I would expect these to last several years before expiring. So their price wouldnt be quite so prohibitive (about $60-$100 ea. for the large versions).\n\nThe balls are a Styrofoam ball filled with fire retardant, like whats inside of a fire extinguisher, there are fuses along the outside that run to a very small explosive charge inside to disperse the powder.\n\nThank you!\n\nI was sent here by /r/findareddit, if there is a better place to cross post this, would someone let me know?\n\n[Link to the original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/findareddit/comments/7hmbq5/want_to_pass_along_a_great_product_idea_to/), it contains no new information.",

            "selftext": "I think it would be cool to make a new image format that creates .gifs that can change between loops. It would be as \u201csimple\u201d as supplying the gifs with accompanying metadata with the frame order. Although the obvious barrier would\u2019ve getting support from browsers. \n\nTo paint you a word picture imagine a .gif that has 6 frames. It would normally play all 6 frames in order over and over forever: 123456\n\nNow imagine an .rgif where we want to swap out the last three frames of the original .gif with three new frames on the second loop.\n\nYou would attach the new frames, making it 9 total, and then supply metadata to give the order:\n123456123789\n\nSo one the first pass you see it starts 123456 but the second pass is 123789, and since it ends there the alternating loop itself loops over and over forever.\n\nThen you could introduce more options like 123456X4123789\n\nThe X signifies how many times you want to loop the preceding segment before moving on the next segment. So 123456 X4 123789, means loop 123456 four times before playing 123789 once, then loop it all over and over.\n\nSure this isn\u2019t exactly how you write the syntax for image processors but it gives a high level idea of what I\u2019m talking about. I think it would be fun to watch .gifs and then all of a sudden you\u2019re like wait...was that loop different?\n",

            "selftext": "To me, by far one of the biggest things that defines the 2010s decade is how different teenage and young adult culture has changed drastically. And how has it changed? Well, it's pretty simple - teenagers are now acting like kids, and young adults are acting like teenagers.\n\nWhereas ten years ago today most of the current trends and interests of today's teens and young adults would get strange looks and could potentially result in social humiliation, in 2017 it's entirely acceptable for the average 15-year old to act like a 10-year old, and the average 25-year old to experience the emotions associated with late adolescence. The first sign of this enormous change was the rise of bronies - male My Little Pony fans - in 2011. They left the Internet truly baffled and their fandom and what it meant was debated constantly online. People just could not understand how grown men (and women) could possible watch a cartoon made for little girls. It just made no sense to most back then; even today bronies are still joked about occasionally.\n\nAnd yet now, six years later, the whole Internet (which is mostly made up of teens and young adults) is near-universally obsessed with kid's stuff as well. Cartoons. Kids' video games. Disney. Memes. Silly apps. Dressing up. Getting messy. We are a generation of really big children, and as every year passes, it becomes clearer and clearer that how people act and what defines their lives at certain ages just doesn't match society's expectations like it used to. Just look at DeviantArt, nerd conventions, the YouTube community. We're a bunch of kids. \n\nAnd this has had some devastating consequences. We have been labelled \"generation snowflake\" and this description could not be more true. These days the average young adult just want to snuggle up with a Pokemon plushie and watch tons of Netflix, or play video games all day, or spend hours texting with plenty of brightly coloured emojis. And when the people of Generation X (people born from the late 60s to the early 80s) point their fingers and say \"You need to act like a real adult!\", that social expectation - to \"grow up\" and do \"adult\" things (get a full-time job, buy a house, learn to drive, get married, have kids) results in people desperately trying to grow up way too fast instead of naturally. This in turn often results in depression, social isolation, anxiety, and potential suicide if that pressure gets too bad. I'm 24 and I went through this in university. I went through a very uncomfortable \"I hate who I am, I need to be more adult\" period and if I go back in time to two or three years ago I'd tell myself to snap out of it and learn to accept my nerdy interests and personality instead of worrying about it.\n\nThus, I propose that the expected ages in which you transition to a certain age demographic should be adjusted. Here in the UK, once you turn 18, you are considered a legal adult. This is downright funny to me, because from what I've seen, both on the Internet and in real life, the average 18-year old acts NOTHING like an adult. I currently work in retail and several of my co-workers are 18/19, and when they're on break they talk and act just like 13-year olds. They're not at all professional, and this shouldn't be expected anymore because of the way the world has changed.\n\nIn my opinion, today people up to age 15 should be considered children, people up to age 25 should be considered the equivalent of a teenager (obviously this name would have to be changed), people aged 26 to 40 should be considered young adults, and people 41 years or older should be considered fully adult. This would go a long way to making the current generation happier, healthier, more united and far less concerned about their current situations and where they should be.",

Thats nice but why dont we go ONE step further.\n\nI came up with this idea because honestly my friends live far and cannot come to a common spot for the holidays...\n\nMy site would work the same, introduce names and emails but there is more: The creator would also choose a price limit, the participates addresses and present gifts from different sites (Amazon, Groupon, iTunes, etc.). Each \"Santa\" would go to the link and they would see the available products in that price limit. They choose one, pay and it would be sent to the person they are assigned to.\n\nIt would be 100% online without any face to face.\n\nIm kind of surprised /r/secretsanta doesnt have something like this already\n",

You may like a shiny new product there with a 1000+ ratings, but how do you recognize that how many of them are fake and how many are genuine? After all, the seller has an incentive to game the system by publishing fake reviews by hiring someone, right?\n\nThe way to recognize a fake review is by the poster. If there were a third-party website that allows reviewers to create profiles and then amazon/ebay allows us to link to those profiles on the third party site, then I think a good vetting system could be created for filtering out fake reviews. This is both good for the genuine sellers and buyers on all ecommerce sites.",

            "selftext": "The future of containing fires with drone technology.\n\nHaving thought of this for the first time 14 years ago, I am still unaware of a simple and effective way of reaching out to the appropriate audience to overview and help guide along the research and development of this project. Hence, I'll start here and urge for suggestions for the next steps. I would also like to find my place, as far as supporting my family while working along with the progression of this development, not as the sit back and benefit type, but as one of the persons within this open source project that remains energetically involved. My vision is complete, but by no means down to the fine details, of components to be used, programing, the research that will fail, etc. Also just wanting to post this now... rather than, to continually rewrite or procrastinate upon it, as I tend to do. The need has been here for such a long time, but no more so than today, i.e. the current California wildfires of 2017; Santa Rosa, Thomas, etc. Then of the fires that will be in 2018 and beyond.\n\nIn reading this, anytime the words, we \u201ccould\u201d or \u201cwould\u201d are used, these are the points made that are to be analyzed, replaced, and evolved by the open source community, that I am hoping that will take an interest in helping push this project towards its potential. \n\n\nThis IS the future\u2026 Hopefully due to its overwhelming need and great advantages, we can and will begin to use this as the solution for wildfires in the next few years. Yet, truly try to imagine it, a foresight of our future in let's say 20 years or more, the future really has no one better option than this, other than an unknown mean... i.e. some amazing new unthought approach of physics the removing oxygen, by removing it as fuel source, or..?\n\nNow mentally picture looking out onto the horizon, head-on at a wildfire. Let's break this down into three zones vertically: (1) Ground Level - (2) Lower Aerial - (3) Upper Aerial.\n\nThe problem with the currently used 2 zones:\n\nGround Level (1): Simply standing on the ground: Currently firefighters are on foot, endangering themselves, using the technology of tools that you would find at a construction site; shovels, rakes, bulldozers, etc., The future of this zone..? Unmanned robotics, hopping over obstacles, ducking under brush, climbing cliffs?\n\nUpper Aerial (3): Above canopy height: Currently airborne tankers drop payloads that are only slightly affective, being that the retardant is acceptable to drift and indirect dispersion that minimally impacts the desired target. It is hard to imagine the future of this zone has anything additional to explore.\n\nLower Aerial (2): This is the new not used zone, not touching the ground and below the upper level of a canopy, it is a close and affective space to address managing a wildfire. Navigated by drones, utilizing the following two up and coming technologies that take advantage of modernizing firefighting and making it massively effective: Drones and Deep Learning.\n\n14 years ago I was residing in Tucson, Arizona in the western foothills of Mount Lemmon. From our backyard, you looked up, not out into the horizon to see the peak. The mountain always felt close and massive. In 2003 a fire broke out, the \"Aspen Fire\". It took a more than a month and 17 million to contain this wildfire, while consuming 85,000 acres. Another incident that was close to home; the \u201cYarnell Hill Fire\u201d in June of 2013; killing 19 firefighters in Prescott, AZ in a unexpected and tragic incident. Watching the Aspen fire line at night once, it seemed that there should be a way to fight it, at hours of the night, upon the shear cliffs that were inaccessible and unsafe for firefighters, it instead sat mostly unattended. Hearing once that a helicopter could carry twice its weight, it seemed that an RC copter at a medium size, not necessarily a small hobby RC copter but one that was something is at medium scale could be a workhorse; get closer, be unmanned and effective. This was before quadcopters and drones were mainstream.\n\nAdvantages of drones vs current manual method\n\nNot inconvenienced by:\n- smoke and weather visibility\n- hazardous inhalation of chemicals\n- navigating landscape, waist high shrubs, steep and awkward terrain\n- being too high that drift is an significant issue\n- heat and fire intensity\n- fatigue and endangerment\n\nOn to the Drone Technology\n\n-- Surveyor Drone(s) --\n\nThe purpose of the surveyor is to elevate itself to a vantage point and then assess an overview of the wildfire. It would contribute and look at affecting factors such as:\n- wind speed and direction, environmental factors, weather data\n- mapping of hotspots\n- use of deep learning to program its own artificial intelligence plan to construct and utilize an effective strategy to control and contain the wildfire, while continually learning, collecting, and processing upon all of the collected data\n\nThe surveyor drone would be present on site in the quantity of 2 to 4. Keeping one always in the air and the other(s) available and prepared to cycle in its place with a fresh charge.\n\n-- Swarm Drones --\n\nA swarm of agile drones that act alone in object avoidance, methods of approach and the application of 100% environmentally friendly fire retardant. These receive instructions from the surveyor or the base transport.\n\nTechnology of drones: \ninfrared - lidar - heat resistant shell - AI countering of winds &amp; other factors to ensure positional stability - any needed additional sensors to cover the collection of beneficial data that amplify the drones effectiveness\n\nThe housing materials of these drones would be that of a fire resistant material. For example if you've ever experienced the capabilities of asbestos, you could put a torch pointing a few inches away from your hand, having a piece of asbestos in between, not feeling or being harmed by the heat. Finding a similar 3D printable / injectable material to build a housing that shields electrical components, and that is used for props, etc. that could be subjected to intense heat.\n\n-- Transport --\n\nCould be a group of:\nSemi Truck &amp; Trailers: Pro: Lesser cost, easier to operate and retrofit / construct. Cons: Arrival time, accessing location.\n\nLarge Transport Helicopters: Pro: \u201cAs the Crow Flies\u201d accessing location. Cons: Expense, and difficult to operate and retrofit /construct.\n\nEither would be dispatched to the wildfire, arrival depending on transport time and availability due to severity. They would house a expansion rack mount system that would dock, transport and charge drones for the energy and consumables needed.\n\n-- Additional Technologies to Explore --\n\nInterior/Exterior Building drone swarm, smaller in quantity and size by comparison, dispersible by customized mid-size truck, units stored on existing firetrucks, effective in navigating and containing residential / commercial building fires, surveys and reports persons in need / danger, preventive measures by identifying explosives and other contained hazards\n\n-- Firefighters --\n\nNo other job on earth seems as great as that of fireman, ones that put their life at risk for our safety and our livelihood. Hopefully this technology can be used to aid them as tools and to take some of the risk out of the situations that they are put into to, all for our benefit. Being that this is in terms Open-Source, this then is also theirs. Firefighters with their knowledge can train initial techniques for deep learning to explore. Learn and train others in the drones usage. Work alongside this technology in the upcoming concept of machines and humans working together.\n\nWorking towards controlling the increasing natural disasters that fires cause.\n\nBrett Andersen\n3retta@gmail.com\nDecember 9th, 2017\n\nP.S.

            "selftext": "TLDR; A law that allows a simple majority of the House and Senate to refer a piece of legislation to a Referendum vote.\n\nHere is an idea. \n\nIf congress is unable to pass a bill into a law with super-majority, or if a bill barely unable to pass due to opposition then any member of the House or Senate may call for a simple up/down vote in general assembly of their respective legislative body by a secret ballot for a referendum vote.   \nIf by simple majority the vote passes, then the resolution calling for a referendum vote is sent to the other respective legislative body, where if met with concurrence from a single member, a second up/down vote is held again by that legislative body.   If again the vote passes by simple majority, then a special assembly is declared where both houses meet determine if a special election is to be held or if the referendum should be held in the next general election and a writ of \"vocatio audire populo\" (A call to hear from the people themselves) is sent to the Attorney General of the United States to carry out and oversee the referendum process.\n\nThere would also be a process to recall the writ of \"vocatio audire populo\".   If congress determines that irreconcilable differences can be resolved before a reasonable cut off time before the vote, then the House or the Senate can call for a recall of the writ (again simple up/down vote) in their respective legislative body.   If it passes, again the vote would be passed to the other house of Congress where if it passes both houses then issue \"an order to recall the writ\" to the Attorney General stating that Congress no longer wishes to hold a public vote. The President of the United States may countermand the order, or the Attorney General himself may uphold the initial writ and if so the referendum vote would continue.   If the vote passes, then the writ becomes law by \"voluntatem populi\" (the will of the people) and cannot be blocked by Congress or Presidential veto.   Only subsequent action by Congress (passing a new law that overrides the first) or Constitutional challenge in the Supreme Court can override the law.   Of course, the same powers and process would apply to the law as any other law, so the President would have power to direct the implementation of the law, but it would still be the law of the land.   \n\nFinally, there would be some key provisions to this process that are important.   First, this could absolutely be used to remove a sitting President and his administration, and any bill created through this process cannot be blocked by the sitting President by means of veto or any other method.   A President may only order that the vote continue to be held even after Congress has attempted recall the writ.   That is why the writ is sent to the Attorney General, because it is his duty along with the Federal Election Committee to ensure the vote is fairly held, and his duty to inform the President of Congress\u2019s decision.   Also, I earlier stated that the initial vote for referendum was to be held by secret ballot, but the Speaker of the House or the House Majority Leader can call on a vote to suspend the normal rules of general order and call on the vote to be scored.   However, in both cases, since these actions are considered procedural they may not be filibustered by a member of the House or Senate.   This means that a vote to hold a referendum can not be blocked by a filibuster or procedural trickery.   This also means if there is a secret vote, only the representatives calling for the vote in the House or Senate are in the spotlight.   \n\nSecond, this procedure, like Article 5 of the Constitution would allow States the right to call on a special referendum, however the rules would be different.  First off, the States would not be able interject their own legislation, they can only issue a writ on legislation set to become law or on legislation vetoed by the President.   Also, unlike Article 5 of the Constitution, the sitting Governors and their State Attorney Generals only would ratify the writ \"vocatio audire populo\", and only a simple majority of States (26 in total) would need to ratify writ.   This means it would not require the entire State Legislator to hold a special session, plus they can exert their influence over the Governorship with threat of impeachment.   Governors would be able to issue a writ on any vetoed legislation but only is so far as the legislation was vetoed by the President during the term of the sitting Governor, or if the Governor took office within the same term that the sitting President issued the veto.  The same would apply to pending legislation set to become law.  States have often used Constitutional challenges to block or dismantle legislation within the court system, and the courts often impart an injunction on laws until the matter can be resolved by the courts.   In this scenario if legislation is set to become a law then the sitting Governors by simple majority can issue a writ \"vocatio audire populo\" allowing the people to decide.   An injunction is placed on the law till the people have voted, and whatever they decide becomes the new law of the land.    Like before this action can only be taken by the Governors if the legislation was signed into law by the President during the term of the sitting Governor, or if the Governor took office within the same term the President signed the bill into law.   \n\nSo that is my idea.   I know it is complicated and long, and probably would not be used much since fear of reprisal would be so high, but I think it would work to give some power back to the people.   Plus, it is kind of just fun to think about these things.   Anyhow, tell me what you think, edit as you see fit.\n",

Peterson) because only that /ideal future fantasies like a promised Eternal Life in the Bible - can create reward hormones - dopamines - which pull us out of depression. \n\nAnd we do know that we do have hormonal inheritance (rat experiments are common knowledge about it) and we do know that stress levels are impacted by sunspots and melodies. Also, we can be informed about the fact that religious melodies change each week regularly. So each week does have a fixed majority melody - as the Bible has ancient melody signs - and these sounds do appear in other music, like in operas whose original date is known.\n\n This way we find Kings (because other people's data are not recorded) in the audience of Operas. Of course Aunt Marika (as Mrs. M. G. wo inspired me - is called by friends) told that we have millions of ancestors back in 500 years so we must filter them. \n\nbecause of this on this List we only look at those Kingly families that are related to the Hungarian King Szapolyai (from the 1500s.) His sister was a Jagello-wife and their daughter married a Hohenzollern, whose descendant married into the Medicis, Bourbons, Windsors, Romanovs.\n\n (And legend says they were also intermarried with the Davidic House to be related to the Meshiah /Christ/ family. Why do we need this rational re-evaluation of archetypal psyhometric horoscopes- as Aristo-Scope? Because this is the rational explanation of the common feeling that horoscope like types do have an effect. \n\nAnd we need to do self-reflection and wise men like C.G. Jung or Jordan Peterson all say that we better switch our focus each week. Now we have a weekly Aristo-Scope list. (The month is the same as traditionally - the other weeks of the month are just like traditional Houses - Family, Age, Work \"houses\".) \n\nSo this week we are in Libra - Politeness. Because of Emperor Charles VI. This is the Hero Ancestor of Sagittarius/=Orderliness/: Henri IV of France. (1591)\n3 \n\nI have the whole List of Dates for each week if someone is interested.",

            "selftext": "I know this post is wordy. Please just give it a chance. Thanks in advance. \n\nI have an idea for a podcast, and even though I read the rules, I\u2019m a little unsure of if idea sharing like this is allowed or frowned upon. Sorry if I broke any rules. \n\nHello! my name is Dan and I\u2019m a college student from Long Island with a focus in Astronomy.\n\n I\u2019m tired of science being so niche and never felt I fit in with my peers, part of the reason I went to 3 astronomy club meetings and never went back. I haven\u2019t been able to ever find a youtube channel, or podcast that seamlessly blends science and pop culture, like hip hop, sports, and TV/movies (I\u2019ll touch on Star Talk later.) I know all of these things sound totally exclusive and not related, but they\u2019re all the reasons that I was always way more into nerdy stuff than the \u201ccool\u201d kids, and shunned from the real geeks because they viewed me as an outsider. I want to change this, and try to make science mainstream. Lets be honest, the only people who watch science videos or listen to science podcasts are people who are either super duper into it l, or pursuing it as a career. I want to make a podcast where we can talk about science, but also relate it to movies, TV, and music. (Not so much sports. Those two will never mesh.) The closest thing is Star Talk, and while I love the goat Neil DeGrasse Tyson, he\u2019s just targeting a slightly different audience. Imagine Star Talk, but make the hosts 30-40 years younger. And with 30-40 years less of scientific knowledge, comes 30-40 years closer to being in tune with pop culture and what will grab teens and 20-somethings attention. \n\nI want to talk as a 19 year old kid, and touch on current events, but be able to converse with friends who maybe aren\u2019t as science savvy as someone like me. We can have segments, like a question of the day, fun fact of the day, inspiring rap lyric of the day, feel good story that relates to science, and we can talk about what new movies are out or coming out that pertain to the show. (Superhero movies, Star Wars, Star Trek, any science movie.) I want people to look forward to listening, and be able to be entertained by different aspects of the show. We might go off on a tangent about exoplanets, Star Wars, The Avengers, Jay Z, Jimmy Fallon, or the new Jordans that just dropped. But I want it to be organic, and happen naturally. The show won\u2019t feel all over the place, because our conversations will be guided by talking points made in advance. And everything will circle back to science. I want to make science fun, and I\u2019m in school to become a high school Earth Science / Astronomy teacher for that reason. But I don\u2019t want to wait until I\u2019m 28 with my first teacher gig. If I can start in advance, and try something new and fun that can be super successful and trailblazing, than why not. Please let me know what you guys think and give as much feedback and constructive criticism as you want. Also let me know if you\u2019d actually listen to something like this or atleast give it a chance when the wheels get turning on it. Thanks so much, and know that I\u2019m passionate about this and want to make science not only hip, but fun and engaging for anyone who tunes in. \n\n\n\nExtra note: I know it may seem all over the place and jumbled at first, but trust me in my head the show is smooth and ties back to science. But realize that this isn\u2019t just an idea for an \u201castronomy\u201d podcast, or a \u201cscience\u201d podcast. It\u2019s a science pop culture podcast. From the perspective of a 19 year old kid who knows as much about rap and the Marvel MCU as he does about the Interstellar Medium. \n\nExtra extra note: I posted this on a few different Reddit communities, just know that I\u2019m not trying to spam. I just think it can be interesting to a lot of different people, and want as much feedback as possible. ",

The concept would be to collect what jobs people do through systems such as tax registration or when payroll registers a new employee's records. \n\nThe problem it is solving is to give job seekers and students an idea of the market. This data can be arbitrarily researched via historical census data or via think-tanks but I believe there isn't a mainstream or live service that is readily available and userfriendly to the public. If you wanted to go a step further, it could outline jobs in a more granular fashion on seniority, pay and other things.\n\nAn example of the problem is there are roughly 60,000 legal jobs but we produce about 12,500 new law graduates every year. Yet people continue to apply oblivious to their impending struggle",

            "selftext": "I think Tesla should manufacture electric riding lawnmowers. Riding mowers rarely leave the owners property, they need a run-time of 1-3 hours, they generally operate at relatively consistent speeds, and would easily support the weight of the motors and batteries.\n\nThe deck could be run by 1 motor and use a belt to connect multiple blades, or 2-3 direct drive motors. This would also lend itself to easy removal of the deck because no belt connection to the tractor would be necessary.\n\nThe tractor itself could be run through a single motor through a transmission (essentially replacing the current engine setup with a motor), or via direct-drive motors on the drive wheels.\n\nElectric riding mowers would be super quiet, which would be awesome on those early Saturday mornings. Plus, there are many accidents involving riding mowers each year. Many of those accidents are, at least partially, attributable to not being able to hear what is going on around the machine (lack of situational awareness). So, in theory at least, they could be safer. \n\nHonestly, I don't see many reasons NOT to do it.\n\nEdit: Looks like I'm behind the times, these things are already showing up. Here and I thought I was clever...oh well, back to being par, or even sub-par. Good day all.",

After she has (and \"loses\") the baby, her husband Guy tells her that she had \"pre-partum-crazies\" which she doesn't believe of course. As the viewers, we are inclined to believe that Guy is lying and he's the bad guy.\n\nIf you reverse the roles and we watch it from Guy's point of view, it tells a totally different story. Rosemary gets pregnant and spirals mentally. She develops forms of paranoia and anxiety, which lead her to be suspicious of the neighbors she already doesn't like very much. Coincidences are just that: coincidences. Guy has to watch his wife grow to hate him and become neurotic and later violent. If we watch if from Guy's perspective, Rosemary is just a crazy pregnant lady and he visits the neighbors frequently for advice or just for sane company. \n\nShe may have had the baby at a hospital and they took it from her to put it in the nursery (which was more common than now) The neighbors may not have even been there. Or, from a darker side, she may have given birth at home and killed the baby and convinced herself that it was a Satanist/witch thing. Guy stands by helpless and since Rosemary went off the deep end, all he can do is watch. \n\nIt would be a much different story from Guy's point of view and I REALLY wish someone would make this happen. Please, someone pick up the idea and do it! ",

Personally, I think most resources out their assume a lot of prior knowledge. This would assume the reader never heard the word college or university before.\n\n\nFor contents, it could contain terminology, many things could be included. A first iteration of the website could be general information. What's a degree, major, minor, specialization, transfer, co-op, grant, loan, studying abroad, university program accreditations and what each accreditation means. Services offered like career services, and mental health counselling. General advice on how to pick a major, university by listing the pros and cons of certain decisions. Even if it seems trivial, future students can get a sense there is a lot to consider, and maybe be informed to new things they never heard of before.\n\n\nFor the next iteration, country specific sections could be created. That explain all accreditations specific to a country. Also, federal loan and grants available to that country, and maybe how to apply for them.\n\n\nAs things continue, you could create a section explaining the broad majors in detail. Like the courses involved, job prospects including the job titles. Web tools. Advice section explaining the pros and cons of different things you could do in your university experience. In addition, different methods for studying. Stories of graduates, and what they liked or wish they did differently. General job search advice. There is limitless potential.\n\n\nBeing a highly scalable idea, you can later do the same for colleges (community colleges for you USA folks), and trade schools. Or different industries, like healthcare. Any big decision that requires lots of research to make a well informed opinion, where currently you have to go to dozens of different websites to get what you need to know. Worst, those website could be blog websites, and there\u2019s not too much of a way to tell if it\u2019s good information to an uninformed reader.\n\n\nTo summarize, the goal of the website would be too centralize all the information you may Google in your research. So, instead of going to 20 websites (without knowing which ones are good or not), you now only go to this one. And it explains every question that somebody could have, so there\u2019s nothing left to ask or be confused about.\n\n\nI believe if you provide every piece of information that could be useful, down to the definition of what a major is, then future kids should theoretically be able to make close to 100% rational decisions concerning their future education. Making their futures a little easier to navigate.",

Sometimes, especially in an engaging conversation, we can only stare at their \"person is typing\", not knowing what they're saying. Often times, when two people are typing at the same time, they end up talking about different topics. These breaks in conversations makes people check other tabs, which cause the person on the other end to also wait, resulting in a shitty loop of waiting. [In fact, an MIT study shows that people spend an average of 10-15 minutes a day waiting while conversing over IM.](https://techcrunch.com/2015/05/13/waitchatter-helps-you-learn-a-new-language-while-you-wait-for-im-replies/)\n\nWhat if there was a chat application where every word gets sent as soon as you type it? The other user can see you backspace, the content as you're typing, and then once you hit enter, the message becomes permanent.\n\nI created an MVP and feedback has been good. People initially thought that it would be scary to use, but it turned out to be really intuitive and makes conversations flow a lot better. Now I'm wondering what you guys think to see if there's enough demand to create a better version of it.\n\nIf you want to test/see the MVP (buggy and uncomplete), then I created a discord channel for this project and I can share the link to the app on there.\nhttps://discord.gg/SWdhG2\n\nOpinions would be great!

The app would indicate when the race starts, show you the progress of others in real time, and allow others to cheer you on. It would require your phone to have GPS and mobile data/indoor wifi.\n\nThere would be an option to post a challenge (with race options) that others can accept. Or you can view a list of challenges by other users and choose which one to accept.\n\nPerhaps have several running events every day (e.g. 5k) so people can race at home.\n\nThat's the basic premise of it.

An alternative testing company employers would use when their hands are tied and they are forced to test, but they found a job candidate they don't want to lose for the bullshit reason of testing positive for THC. \n\nIn the last company I did hiring at, I'd estimate we lost at least 25% of very qualified candidates due to testing requirements because we were a federal contractor. Either through tests coming back positive, candidates not showing up for testing once they found out it was required, or just not even applying in the first place because they knew. \n\nAll upper management knew the requirement was stupid, and from personal knowledge I'd say at least 50% of the people who got the positions used MM eventually once they were hired anyway. Not a single work-related incident in 7 years related to it, of course. Opioids, yes, and we even lost one person to them. MM, never.",

One alphanumeric character here, at least three numbers here, must have one special character here, no special characters here. Oh, and change your password once every three months and it can't be the same as the last thirty passwords. \n\nWithout a password manager, it's basically impossible to remember it all. And most people don't want to use password managers or update them. \n\nCurrently, Google Authenticator is used as a 2FA RNG. If you have 2FA enabled on a website, you enter your password and then enter the 6 digit code on your Authenticator app into the webpage. Boom, signed in. \n\nMy idea eliminates the first step altogether, if web developers set it up. \n\nBasically, you still have the option of signing in with your password, but if you would rather not or don't want to keep up with it, the website can send a request to the authenticator app, which will then request a fingerprint or face ID scan. \n\nOnce the correct fingerprint or face ID is scanned, the app THEN generates the standard six digit code you enter on the webpage. Web developers of low security sites (eg., Pizza hut) could opt out of the code altogether and it could sign you in as soon as you scan your finger print. \n\nI would love to see the way passwords work change in the future because I get so sick of typing variations of my passwords ten times, failing, resetting my password, then doing the same next time I log in.

Does every single venue have a table available without fail? No. Are they the same height/size? No. Can I design a stand that will fit somewhere on the bike, so I can use the gig box as a table? Perhaps the 20 inch legs can be built and fit somewhere? Can the ammo boxes have brackets added to become a sturdy pillar? Then they would have to be removable from the bike and that presents bike bracket design problems as seen previously (hence redesign).\n\n\nWhat am I missing and how can I improve and streamline this process?",

I believe I finally found something that might work for everyone.\n\nThe basic idea is that the user is able to \"favorite\" or \"subscribe to\" critics like they would a Youtube channel.  Then when a film comes out, you get to see a seperate aggregate score that uses only those reviewers.  Some benefits of this:\n\n1) People like and dislike things for very individualized reasons, and this solution is highly individualized.\n\n2)  By adding or removing reviewers from your \"Favorites\" you can curate your tastes as they change over time...or as you learn more about the tastes of that reviewer.\n\n3)  Easy to implement\n\nI think this could possibly be done with an extension or plugin.  It could be kickstarted with a survey: lists polarizing films (40 to 60% range) and ask the user to rate.  Match/recommend \"favorites\" reviewers to the user nased on their answers.\n\nI have more thoughts, but honestly I am more curious to hear feedback.  Let me know what you think!",

            "selftext": "So, I've been kind of wanting to do something like this for a while, and I finally decided that I would do some thinking about it to see how feasible it would be. Unless we were to find some accurate information down to the year level, we *could* in fact bodge our way through it with estimations.\n\nFirst off, the template. The calendar would be like this - [E:M1:M2:]Y mm/dd hh:mm:ss\n\nSo, the sun is approximately 5 billion years old. That means that, with current estimates of the speed of the sun around the Galactic centre, we revolve around it every 225 million years. I have called this value the \"Era\", or &lt;E&gt;. Again, assuming the sun is 5 billion years old, that would place us in the 22nd Era. \n\nM1 stands for Millional. Given that Eras are *extremely* long, we should probably divide them into Millionals, which are periods of one million years. We are approximately 22% through the current Era, making us within the 50th Millional. \n\nNow, this is where much more creative licence comes about. M2 stands for Millennium. Where we are here really depends on the accuracy of the calendar (currently low as we know so little about the exact timeframes down to the thousands of years), so there are a number of starting points to the current Millional we could choose. We could use the creation of the oldest currently known temple (placing us in the 13th Millennium), we could use the founding of Uruk, the first known city (7th Millennium), the foundation or fall of the Roman (or another) Empire, anything really. This could be ironed out if I ever seriously start thinking about this. \n\nThe first three could be noted if they are needed, but would not always be noted necessarily. Next, however, is the year. Depending what we use as the starting date would decide what year we use. \n\nI don't think I really need to explain months, days, hours, minutes or seconds, though I should probably explain that I was intending on naming the months after influential astronomers throughout history. I considered making the start of the year an astronomically significant event (equinox, solstice etc.), though I struggled to find one which would remain constant, so I think the start of the year can remain fairly arbitrary. Also, while I have not seriously considered this, if there were a more mathematically consistent manner to divide the months into (which, due to the strange number of days in a year, may be difficult) that would be preferable, but again, I have not considered anything like this.\n\nSo, what do we all think? Personally, I think we could easily do away with irrelevancies that exclude one group of people in exchange for another and focus on one thing which unites all of the members of our human species - our journey through space, around a massive ball of gas.

            "selftext": "It would be a top-down game with an art style similar to Don't Starve, or We Need to Go Deeper, except more 3D-looking.  You would play as a deep sea animal starting as a small one and unlocking other fish and deep sea creatures to play as.  There would be an elevation system where you could go deeper or higher up and there would be different things in each layer.  Some playable fish wouldn't be able to go past certain layers for long.  There would be a hunger meter, and you would have to eat other organisms to fill it up.  There would also be a health meter, which would obviously lower when attacked, or when your hunger goes down all the way.  You start out small, and eating makes you grow, but every fish would have a size limit.  There would be many different things to find, and exploring would be encouraged.  The main goal of the game would be to survive as long as possible, and surviving would give you coins to unlock other fish.  The best creature would be either the giant squid or colossal squid, which would be the creature responsible for the most deaths in the early to mid game.  However, playing as it will cause the sperm whale to be able to appear, which can eat the squid.  What do you think about this game?",

            "selftext": "It appears as though a lot of Youtubers take screenshots of comments on their videos manually if they are featuring them in their videos (as they are irregularly shaped screenshots.)\n\nUsing the YouTube API, someone could re-render the comments programmatically and then have a script which would take a screenshot of each one. This would allow comments to be searched for certain keyword(s), or go through a sentiment analysis/machine learning algorithm to filter them, or search by number of likes on each comment. A user could click a button in their web browser and be re-directed to a new website which would allow them to search and then download the images of the comments as a ZIP file.\n\nThis would allow a Youtuber to feature comments in their videos much more easily as they don't have to take a screenshot of each comment individually, have to scroll down the page, wait for more to load, and take more screenshots. Also, it would prevent accidentally taking a screenshot of the same comment twice.\n\nEdit: I decided to make it since it would be a fun project. So right now if I plug in a Youtube video ID into this app, I get a folder of image files with each comment screen captured. It also captures the entire comment, even if it is twenty+ lines long and requires the user to click \"Read more\" to see the entire thing. The comments can also be exported to a spreadsheet file with filenames, so you can run your machine learning/sentiment analysis/filters on it, and just choose the images that match that criteria. ~~However, I'm having problems parsing some UTF-8 characters so some of the comments look a bit wonky, but it's totally fixable.~~ Also, I found out the comment images can be exported to svg's, which means that you can zoom into the comment/look at it on a retina display and it will look super crisp.\n\n~~Unfortunately I can only export 50 comments at a time to screenshots, and they seem to be randomly ordered. So it could take a while to export thousands of comments.~~ It seems to be a limitation of my underpowered VPS so this would work better with a faster computer. ",

So it is not possible create a transparent LCD that become white..\n\nI saw also the OLED transparent panel can create light area, because they are like a lot of micro led that make light. So it is not possible create a transparent OLED that become black..\n\nMy idea, I think you already got it, is create a sandwich with an OLED panel and one or two LCD panel, I think that a 1x1 OLED panel is sufficient and with two lcd we can create a double side screen, that show both side the same thing (mirrored each other), and that is completly transparent when is turned off.\n\nIs it completely an idiot idea?

            "selftext": "Fly-by-wire aircraft typically have ''laws'' in terms of their flying functionality. There's ''normal law'' which has all the computerization, ''alternate law'' which has some computer features disabled, ''direct law'' that enables manual control through computer commands, and then there's ''mechanical law'' in case the computer goes completely haywire, with basic controls such as rudder and pitch.\n\nFor a driverless car I think there should be three laws, ''normal'' that is being essentially driverless, and restricted to a certain speed limit, ''alternate'' which is where the driver has computer power steering, braking, etc. Then ''mechanical law'' where power steering etc is lost, but in the event the drive by wire becomes unstable the driver is still safe. The car should have cabin lights that also alert other drivers. In ''normal'' law the cabin lights are blue, in ''alternate'', they're green. In ''mechanical'', they are red.\n\nIf the two computers disagree with each other, then depending on the error the car may revert to alternate law. \n\nI think this is a good alternative to just flat-out giving the driver no say and removing the steering wheel completely. There would be alarms whenever the car is either switching laws or if the driver engages or disengages them, similar to how it works in the cockpit of an airplane. In ''mechanical law'' the driver still has basic control of the engine, transmission, steering and brakes.\n\nThis way, there would be benefits of both computer redundancy *and* the driver being there, correcting the car's course in case the computer makes a mistake or suffers a glitch. There are many instances of computer error happening in fly by wire planes, that if it weren't for the pilots being in the cockpit, the plane would have been lost.  The combined factor of computer **and** human control is what makes planes the safest mode of transport.\n\n",

Acetylcholine inhibitors also promote relaxation, since acetylcholine is associated with alertness and wakefulness. In other words these chemicals are the complete opposite of the chemical compound caffeine, which does essentially the reverse. \n\nThese drinks would differ from alcohol being that the sedative is in small amounts, and wouldn't degrade the brain and liver over time. They'd likely be legal, so stressed out teenagers or college students could come hope and sip a few of these to relax. Possibly also helpful for people with anxiety. ",

            "selftext": "After listening to several podcasts like \"How I Built This with Guy Raz\" and the \"Entrepreneurial Thought Leaders Podcast\", I think the biggest problem entrepreneurs have is discovering what customers NEED in order to determine what they should build their business around.  It seems that many entrepreneurs were lucky enough to discover a business opportunity because they were in the right place at the right time.  Entrepreneurs shouldn't need to serendipitously stumble on business ideas that improve people's quality of life, world problems (as big or as small as they may be) should be easily identifiable and stamped out quickly.\n\nThere should be a site/app/platform where people post everyday problems that they experience, so that products can be developed around the problem.  This arrangement also allows crafty people to work as freelancers.  The concept is not quite like platforms like Upwork because the \"problems\" would be posted by people that are simply posting a problem, not contracting work. The posts should be tagged and grouped and the number of posts of a certain kind (demand for a certain kind of product) should be easily determined.\n\nAs an example, users on the platform can post detailed descriptions to the effect of, \"I need something that can do W...\", \"Why hasn't anyone come up with a better X in 25 F#*@ing years? ...\", \"It would be great if this product could also do Y...\", \"I have been forced to buy Z from this company for years now because they're the only manufacturer even though their product and service is horrible...\", or \"My B just broke in the same way again...\".  A system would determine that problem B, X, and Z are similar based on users' descriptions and entrepreneurs can focus on product that have more in common, that share similar keywords, or that have been upvoted by members that have payed $1 in escrow to the platform to prove they're interested in a solution and, more importantly, that they're real people that may be willing to spend money.\n\nLightbulb seems to be a great place to discover ideas and it seems like it could be modified to be something like what I'm thinking above as well as something like the inverse of a Kickstarter, where users put up money for a product they want researched and developed rather than developers pitching their idea to see if there's a demand.\n\nI have more thoughts about this, but this is my first post on Reddit, and I'm sure others may elaborate on this idea in ways I couldn't even imagine, so I'm going to post this idea as-is.",

Its usually a better bargain for the money, you get to retire earlier, do sports, enjoy your passions, travel the world. Work remotely and there is no better place to do this than the sea.

Im wondering what some of you would think about it\n\nwhy dont we start burrying whole family trees, in one plot? instead of 6 ft down.. the oldest would be say, 50 ft down, 6 ft of dirt over them, if its a couple bury their loved one 50 ft down next to them, again, 6 ft of dirt over them.. then the next family meber to pass be burried 44 ft down.. you get my point.. u could get many more people burried in one area.. the grave stone area could be a touch screen.. touch it to bring up the info of anyone burried there, pictures of them in life, videos even if they prefer... listen.. i think that would be absolutely amazing. that way families arent burried all over the place, they are all burried on the same plot of land, future generations could easily go find their past lineage to visit them.. imagine this... those touch screen grave stones... they are wi fi connected.... so lets say my mother who passed 3 years ago.. if she was burried this way I could jump on the net, send a msg to her, either private (which she wouldnt see, but it would be for your peace of mind) or public for anyone to see when they visit the plot.. now, we could go another step further.. that grave stone thats connected via wifi.. the casket could be connected to it with speakers inside.. you could speak, or play music for the person burried there, that would play in the casket.. all of which would be powered via the sun\ufeff",

            "selftext": "Many other nations around the world, namely [Britain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_Office_Ltd) and [Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsche_Postbank) offer some form of basic banking services to their customers from within the post office. They do everything from small loans, debit/credit cards, bank accounts, foreign currency conversion by mail, and even insurance. \n\nAlthough at first it may be difficult for the USPS to offer all of these services, offering even just banking accounts and small loans would allow people of lower income a way to save and manage their money and not have to rely on predatory lenders for things like [payday loans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDylgzybWAw). It could also serve as a more efficient strategy for distributing federal benefits. For the USPS, this could also solve some of the issues they they have been having with funding problems. \n\nMy thoughts come after reading a few stories I found on [Salon](https://www.salon.com/2014/02/26/the_post_office_can_save_america_10_ways_postal_banking_can_fix_some_of_societys_worst_problems/), [NewRepublic](https://newrepublic.com/article/116374/postal-service-banking-how-usps-can-save-itself-and-help-poor) and [Slate](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/history/2014/08/postal_banking_already_worked_in_the_usa_and_it_will_work_again.html). Many of these ideas have been tossed around for years, but with its ability to solve several significant problems in the US, from safer, less risky banking, to job creation and more, it's a surprise that we haven't pushed to make these changes to the USPS already.

            "selftext": "I just had this brainrant (brainstorming rant) at work with a coworker, and wanted to write it down. \n\nTL:DR - Car radios and console units suck\n\nWith all the advancements in Autonomous driving coming out, I feel a crucial step has been missed in the process. While it's a cool idea, I don't feel it helps with the average driver in any ways. Where I feel this improvement could be made is with the car stereo / console / computer systems, and car communications.\n\nHere are some of the ideas or thoughts I've had. Not all of them are original, but that's not what this is about.\n   \n   \n   \n*Radios Themselves*  \n\nI hate car radios. The face plates are ugly. There are so many options that aren't needed 90% of the time. Once you buy a unit, you are stuck with what you have. Not many of them update, and the customization only includes what color it is most the time.  \n\nI may be wrong in the basics of this, but there are two basic functions of a car stereo: A way to input audio, and a way to transfer the audio input to the speakers. I don't feel the transfer part of it is very important and doesn't need to change much, but the inputs are horrible (as stated above). Two ideas I have to improve this would be either an actual computer based system, or cell phone control of the device. More on the computer based system in the next point. For cell phones, why can't your phone be the brain behind your speakers? Insert phone into stereo system, and your're connected! Customization is opened up because you can now choose from multiple app options to run your stereo, or write your own if you don't like any available. Hardware replacements are now trivial as well, as a new phone updates your whole system. We already use the phone for phone calls using Bluetooth and GPS, why not take it this step further?\n\n*Console Units / Computer Systems*  \n\nSay that the above solution isn't enough for you. Why not make it a full on computer? I know some higher end cars offer some sort of this, but going back to the point above: once you buy the unit, you are stuck. Why can't these be more like desktop computers? Have modular parts that you can upgrade and update yourself. Why not have customization or choice of OS that can be upgraded? Software updates? My wife has a Toyota Rav4, and Toyota's proprietary console OS nonsense is infuriating to navigate... Why not branch out to allow it to do more things? Why stop here?\n\nWhy not have the console interact more with the car while we're at it? The car already has the ability to give off error codes, why not allow the console to translate them to human readable format? The above mentioned Toyota system has a ton of neat features and back end accesses normal users aren't supposed to be able to access. Why not make them more upfront? Error light comes on, most users go to the repair shop (which gives the manufacturer more money) for simple fixes that anyone can do. Why not up front say \"Front left tire is low on pressure\" and assist you with finding a nearby gas station that has free air? When an actual error comes up for the engine, why not explain what is happening. If you actually need to go in for repairs, have it tell you that, but also give you an explanation. Some people may be content with \"Camshaft position sensor error\", but I want to know more! Why cant' I fix it myself? If you don't want it on the screen, let it email you so you can read about it on your phone or computer later.\n\n*takes deep breath* \n\nSorry, got ranty there a second. I have more thoughts on this, but the basic principle is there.\n\nInstead of proprietary OS, why not a proprietary API? Setup a PC based system where the car requires the latest update from the manufacturer to allow it to speak to the car. Allow you to fully customize your experience to what you want without replacing the car or while system, but allow the manufacturer to support the API so all interaction is kept uniform at that level. I feel there is a lot of wasted real estate in the car where this useless radio or console system is currently sitting.\n\n*Car communications*\n\nWhy not allow cars to all talk to each other? Think of a hive mind type situation. While it's all fine and dandy that cars can \"drive themselves\", why not assist human drivers that are already on the road? When you get in your car, have it welcome you. \"Hello Evi1Monkey, where are you going today? Work? Awesome, lets do this!\". City driving could be slightly improved by this, but highways could be safer. Other car don't need to know my start and end point, but all cars that are withing x distance of  know i'm not getting off in the next mile, they know how to react better.  Oh look, my exit is coming up! The cars can adjust to safely let me get off at my exit. Let the cars work together to help without sharing any personal information other then location and intent. I've seen examples of this online before, why is it not being used?\n\nThis would be very beneficial to trucks as well. If the truck knows where a vehicle will be, verses guessing, it helps them get between point A and point B more safely. I could keep going with ideas, but this is starting to get very long...",

One way I thought of would be have a user manually input the time It takes for them to respond to a message weather it being 30 min or 30 hours they user can manually list how long itl take them to respond to a message to let other users know so they it can be more convenient for them if they don't have time or if they hate waiting. Their is more that goes into it but those are the skeleton of it. Other features include: Message receipts for convenience Matching with people tinder style to eliminate awkwardness Auto swipe feature to eliminate effort (we won't have an algorithm that'll punish you for it)\n\n\n\n\n\nThese are just core features and are liable to change in case you guys don't like/want them. The core features are obviously gonna be free. The premium will have a subscription of 6.99 that'll further benefit you. Please give me feedback. If you guys like it I'll start a kickstarter so I can build it.",

It could have auto object detection and so wouldn't spray anything if there was nothing in front of the sensor a meter away for example, so that you couldn't accidentally spray something you didn't want to.\n\nIt's a bit unpractical since it would drive up the water sprayer's cost up a lot. The sensor however would be small enough to fit inside of the sprayer however (it's about a size of a US quarter.)",

            "selftext": "This idea came to me about two years ago when the first of the new Star Wars Battlefront games came out. I was really intrigued by the game incorporating actual characters into the multiplayer first person shooter genre.\n\nBut this was rarely used in the game. Mostly as a power up or in really unpopular modes of play. Therefore, I found was is literally the perfect game idea and I\u2019m sure it could easily turn into a series.\n\nHere it is. Take a popular TV show, movie, video game, comic book, etc., and mix it with a multiplayer FPS. Take the conquest mode in the Battlefield series, for example. 60 players and 6 objectives to try and capture to drain the opposing team\u2019s tickets. It could be good guys versus bad guys. Each of the 60 players plays as a different character from the show/movie and uses them as their \u201csoldier\u201d for each match. Every match you can pick a different character (maybe by unlocking some in a story mode?), and that character each has their unique abilities as seen in their original media. There can be modes like team death match, conquest, capture the flag, etc. I really think that this can and should be a thing. Perfect examples of this would be Game of Thrones, The Walking Dead, superhero movies, anything with a wide variety of characters (at least 60, of course), to give everyone ample choice of who to play as.",

He suffers from severe lack of vitamin D and due to this feels something that he\u2019s only been able to describe as severe arthritis in his legs. His brother made a joke about him power washing using a wheelchair and my father came up with something close enough.He switched the blades out of a rideable lawn mower and replaced it with the components of a surface cleaner. The invention has cut a significant amount of time off of finishing power washing jobs and eliminated all the strenuous work force required to not only push a surface cleaner but also pull the water-filled pressurized hoses behind it. I will post a quick clip of how it looks in action for those interested. As of right now he\u2019s been sitting on the patent for about 4 years give or take and we are not in a place to be able to really do anything with it. I come to you all in hopes of learning what some options are and appreciate any feedback. [Rideable Surface-Cleaner](https://youtu.be/vWU0xWGQQJA)",

Because Hollywood movies 98% of the time are recycled stories almost zero entertainment value (other than X big name actress/actor and 98 explosions). Even a lot of the newer 'amazing' movies are almost entirely visuals with a very thin plot.\n\n\nMeanwhile outside of Hollywood, and the United States, we have some real gems being made. Movies with actual stories, with characters that feel real, and plots that get us interested. I think many people would watch movies in the theater if the movies were actually worth watching.\n\n\nIt could even be made more profitable if it had smaller screens so they could play a wide variety of movies at any given time, deliver food to your seat, have events, etc.\n\n\n\nI know for a fact that there are some theaters like this, however I don't believe it is an actual trend and is more or less a few independently owned theaters ran by really clever owners. I wish this was an actual trend and we could find these theaters in every major city. Tired of the Hollywood bullshit, but I also want to see movies in a theater.",

            "selftext": "I find closed captions very helpful when watching TV, movies, and videos online. However, it can be frustrating when there is additional text (open captions) in the presentation and the closed captioning overlaps. Some Television sets allow the view to choose the location of the caption, however this still can be frustrating is the open caption is in changing locations.\n\nFor example, it is common for movies to place language translations at the bottom of the screen, but names, dates and other information in the top left corner. The movement does not need to be drastic, but small adjustments slightly above or below appearing open captions would be ideal. \n\nHaving automatic caption placement adjustments can help viewers better enjoy presentations and not miss information from closed and open captions overlapping.

A built-in user base that you can deliver to content creators. Who has an already huge user base? Netflix.\n\n&gt;I know you're worried about losing your fans, but Netflix already has 100 million users, an established brand that people trust and a marketing team that can ensure people everywhere know where you are, whether they're subscribers or not.\n\nOffer a free video service and just provide premium add-ons to those that are already subscribers. You don't need to pimp out a YouTube Red-like service because you already have it.\n\nYouTube and Twitch already did a lot of troubleshooting for you, Netflix. There are pages and pages and pages of suggestions out there on how to make the best possible service and you don't even need to pay for the research.\n\nThe time is *RIPE!* Simply reach out and grab it!",

Spacex probably doesnt give a crap about those stages, but the parts could be used for other purposes such as an engine for a spacecraft. Since it is already in orbit, you dont have to pay extra money to launch engines. Same goes for defunct satellites, the dead chinese space station, and other rocket stages. So, potentially, you could build lots of interesting things in space for cheaper. dont want to lug engines? Find some. Want a body for spacecraft? Take the tiangong 1 before it burns up. Need solar panels? Salvage dead satellites. You could build a earth orbit activity. then, you could go mine asteroids, or explore other planets for useful materials or do whatever, for far cheaper than just launching a massive spaceship.

            "selftext": "What if Netflix had a vintage category with shows from the 70\u2019s, 80\u2019s and 90\u2019s? They would run popular shows from the time and when it\u2019s time for a  commercial break they play vintage commercials. \n\nThey could charge companies to air their old ads (if that company is still around.) It would also be a way for companies to get involved in advertising through Netflix by airing their vintage commercials through them.  Companies wouldn\u2019t have to pay to create ads as they are already created for them. \n\nI don\u2019t know, I thought about this the other day and just thought it was a fun idea and wanted to share.

This service would of course need the backing of production studios and of course would disrupt the movie industry. An anti piracy system would need to be in place as well (like the movie could only be viewed through some sort of lock down browser software. This service would have features like rewind, a real time plot analysis that helps you better understand whats going on. It would also incorporate the chat feature during live shows in youtube videos as a way to socialize the viewing experience(this being optional of course and with an algorithm that prohibits spoilers). It would also include a critic section where the rating is community based liking like you-tube videos. The studios would be incentive-ized by getting revenue both from movie sales and money from ads placed before the movie starts (kinda like previews). I realize that with all big ideas, industries get disrupted and there are always losers, in this case the actual theaters. I'd love your guys input though?  ",

            "selftext": "Let me start off by saying, I am not a scientist, I am a boy scout that comes up with dumb ideas. So, one thing they teach us in survival camping classes is that it is possible to make drinkable water from salt water by boiling it, and directing the vapor into a cup or bowl to cool back into liquid. Supposedly, this leaves the majority of the salt that makes the water undrinkable behind. First of all, does this even really work?\n\nSo, that got me thinking about that it might be possible to use, say the water that cools nuclear plants, in this way. My idea was that you could use salt water to cool a nuclear plant, then leave the salt behind when the water is boiled, and instead of letting the water vapor escape into the air, it could be directed to a treatment plant to clean out the remaining impurities. To me, this seems more energy efficient as it would remove most of the salt from the water without requiring any more electricity than normal.\n\nDoes anyone have any scientific insight into whether this could or could not work?",

This will be a temporary home for people to live and work at until they finally get a proper job, redo their education and so on, and when they leave, more can come. Only issue is, you would literally need millions to start this up, once it gets going however, it will produce money just by existing.",

            "selftext": "**Problem**\nI use a house sitting website, a place where people come together to help each other.  The website has a built-in messaging system for communication between parties (before you directly connect).\nThe problem is that the website sends email notifications of these messages to you, without the message included.  I believe they do this to make you log in to the website to read the message, letting them know you have read the message, changing the \"unread\" to \"read\" at that time.\nThe website is cumbersome at best on a mobile phone, and I often just want to have a 2-way chat with the person quickly. [Comment screen shot](https://www.dropbox.com/s/dmunpv5ylvab34s/2018-01-18%2009.28.34.png?dl=0)\n\nSites this would apply to:\n* community sharing economy sites like Trusted House Sitters, Love Home Swap\n* job sites like TaskRabbit, Air Tasker, People Per Hour,  oDesk/ Upwork, Freelancer\n\nExisting solutions\nUpwork, for example, has their own mobile messaging system, that is pretty unreliable at best, also have the ability to reply directly to the email as they use userid_messageid.email@upwork type system.\n\n**Solution**\nI use WhatsApp for IM, as it has the little message delivered and the message read indicators, the basic requirements that these websites require.\nI imagine either an integration with WhatsApp or another stand-alone app, let's call in WebsiteIM.\nOne that allows website messaging systems to interact with it directly.  Eg. you sign up to a site, like trustedhousesitters.com, then oAuth connect with WebsiteIM to communicate with it.\nAfterwards, you initiate a communication with a user on that website.  When they reply, you get a new thread appearing in WebsiteIM, just like a message thread in WhatsApp or Facebook Messenger.\nTo keep spam to a minimum there would need to be the ability to report websites and users that are abusing the system, it could only be used for 2-way communications between users in place of the websites own internal messaging system.\n\n*Some techy thoughts*\nI am sure an existing platform could do this easily like WhatsApp, Facebook messenger, Google Hangouts or one of the many other IM apps out there - this would bring the user base up a lot as people switched over all their IM use to the app that supported it.\nThe website internal messaging system could integrate into this system using the WebsiteIM API easily, after the oAuth connection is made.\noAuth connections would mean it is very simple for a user to allow a website to use the system to notify them.  Further to that rules that made a user initiate a conversation on the website directly would keep abuse to a minimum.\nWeb and native app's would be small and have push notification options. \n\nAny other thoughts as comments would be great.\nIf you want this idea to happen, then upvote - maybe if a lot of us upvote a platform will build an API to do it, or one will be built :D",

Due to the increasing intoxication, this cycle can continue until a fatal overdose occurs. If patients had a little log to jot down when they last took a pill, they could look at the log and a clock before taking another, or if they choose to take another (some scripts say 1-2 so maybe they're like *shrug* 'another would be great!') they would know not to take another after their next nod.\n\nI know some people already do this but if it was validated on an official level and part of the process of getting prescribed medication and the pharmacist actually went over that with patients, then perhaps opiate overdoses could be reduced (among legitimate-use precription opiate overdoses)",

Over the centuries there have been organizations whose objectives have been diverse some are eradicate the humanity; enslave her; etc...\nThe problem are these \"demons\" even the \"angels\" hurt the humans; because of that some groups fight Whit these creatures but one group (technically they are not group there are individuals who fight) they called \"the cursed ones.\nThis individuals have the power of immortality and depending of the circumstances another ability.\nThe cursed ones have existing in ancient times when the humanity have beginning they civilization.

They appear in randomly circumstances even in the actual time have appear.\n\nBut this history is about one especially one of the longest who have fight Whit these creatures for centuries and here is one of his histories\n(Well this is only a resume of the plot next is a part of the history)\nSuccubus\nCursed: Tell me Father you even have seen a Succubus eh....\nFather: No but I have ear how is to fight with one of them\nCursed: Well tell me how is appearance his\nFather: Ok; the succubus is creature how have the power tho visit in you dream's and drain you live energy through sexual activities his origins date from the medieval age the apereance suggest a beauty woman Whit a very splendid body they appear in the actually like references in any tipe of entertainment but... I know you were involved so everyone would think that if I'm wrong.\n\nCursed: Yeah look what can you do Whit a little of magic and some hokers.\nFather: but why?\nCursed: you need to see how they leave their victims.\nFather: I know the storys and after the encounter they decided to end his life\nCursed: not all of us are lucky the others can not end is life are in some psychiatric hospital looking like vegetables.\n\nFather: well changing of topic, tell me about one of the most interesting encounters you have with one them.\n\nCursed: Well there he goes , it was in Italy year 1995 the priest Alessandro De Lucca he ask me the favor to investigate some murders around the city of Florencia the victims have very particular similitutes sexual organs destroyed,\n\nWhit marks of cannibalism: apparently only atacked hokers male and female but in the recently months his modus operandi have changed he attacked pregnant women's: kids, nuns, and anyone's who cruised in his pass.\n\nIt was no longer a fucking lunatic who the police can't stop so. Alessandro call me and tell me the priest the Vatican send to stop the succubus was found in a fuckin motel dead the only thing who was able to recognize was his rosary beads.\nIt take me 3 day's to found him; you now the succubus are one of they few cant take the form of a human who has the dreamlike carteristics that the victim wishes for a companion and this succubus was in the hunt of a very famous actor.\nFather: Wait a minute 1995 is the year of the assassinations of the cannibale sessuale but he never killed a actor.\nCursed: well the Vatican interfere and they blame out a pedophile priest of the murders and we'll about the actor I was to late to save him because of that they say he died from a overdose.\n\nWell this how this happened hi was in the House of that actor I run to his room I what I see it was to late he was wrapped in some kind of disgusting pus of blood, bones, skin Whit dregs of the poor guy all over the fucking succubus he tried to scream but in his mouth had some kind of slug made of some kind of repulsive meat and it was no over in all over his body some repulsive fetus triyin to devouring him alive especially they try to eat his sexually organs even I think I saw some kind of baby hands in his butt. He tried to scream and cry but he could no doet.\nWhen I saw this I think the only way to kill that thing and end the suffering of that guy is Whit fire and lucky I have some Molotovs to help me Whit that.\nFather: wait if you burn his house and he died Whit fire how they do to look like he died Whit overdose\nCursed: the Power of the Vatican: well I forgot to say it but you now the succubus become like that.\nFather: yes: God prohibited angels have sexual desires because of that the majority of angels act like children but wen an angel try the sin of lust he become one of that things but not only the angels become like that sometimes that fallen angel find a person Whit a immune and depraved sexual desires who can turn in on e of this misters.\nCursed: now tell me you prefer be attacked Whit one of those things or a sexy woman....\nWell this is only a resume his escaped some parts.if you have some advice of how do better the history let me now.

            "selftext": "Hey guy's, so its summer in Western Australia atm and my car turns into a microwave (45c/113f) by 8:30AM and stays like that till sunset ~7:30PM. \n\nI have a sunshade that I picked up on the cheap but its so annoying to put up every time I turn the motor off. \n\nSo I started thinking about a sunshade that would automatically deploy from the roof liner of my car, a quick goog's offers nothing really, a patent (US 20060202501 A1) but nothing of substance. Has anyone seen anything commercially? Otherwise id bee keen to build a prototype but have no idea where to start so some tips or inventing resources would be great. \n\n\ntldr: its hot in summer, I want an automatic sunshade to deploy from the roof liner of my car.

It would be available in many languages and use both text and audio in case of illiteracy, blindness or deafness, which would be pretty straightforward for the airline to do.\n\nThere are literally no downsides to having this test in place, except the passengers on the plane having to spend a whole 4 minutes or less of time that probably won\u2019t be spent doing anything better ensuring that in the case of an emergency they are less likely to injure and/or endanger those around them for reasons like incompetence.",
