            "selftext": "People do know things. They often know what they like based on experience and thought, and how they feel about morals, whether that means their opinion is fully developed and independent to learned information or not. Believe in yourself. You should be respected, understood and based on what you are capable of, able to live a life of your fantasy. I think you should highly a consider a creative and/or mechanical outlet, because creativity, whether that be an art form or new solutions to problems and inconveniences, is an act of charity, can save and influence lives, and this is how you will earn your desires in life. You will be able to escape your dreads this way.\n\nHere are some questions to get you started:\n\nWhat is the act of possessing conditional love? Shouldn't you care about everyone 100%, including yourself? Shouldn't you want to be there for everyone, regardless of their choices? Isn't it possible that everyone needs you in some way, therefore making you and everyone else 100% needed and necessary to fulfill that possibility? \n\nAren't we all a family of living creatures? Isn't doing something solely because of tradition foolish? Isn't behaving due to other's opinions and desires shallow and limiting? Aren't children, among others, able to understand ideas that are new to some people? Isn't it meaningless to have respect because you do things the same way that other people do them?\n\nWith all the people and ideas in the world, isn't it foolish to pick one as a romantic partner? Do you believe there is only one person with potential for you to be with, or for you to be happy with? Do you believe the entire Earth isn't worth traveling and interacting with? Do you think it is mature and wise to limit yourself due to apathy and fear? Do you think there is only one, or a few well-known, tried and true molds for how to live your life and reproduce? Do you think all of the creative and scientific ideas have been realized, or that there is too much practice involved in inventing something with value to you or others? Do you believe that waiting and wishing will consistently and eventually result in your wildest desires? \n\nAnd finally, why do you believe you will be conscious after death without an anatomy?",

This cycle continues, until eventually money is circulating and flowing better, allowing people the cash injections they may need while continuing a steady growth. \n\nI think I speak for a lot of people when I say that everyone seems to be on the back foot with money.

            "selftext": "Hi, I'm not exactly sure what sub I should have posted this, but I figured this would be the best place. Anyways, I work for a company and we basically make programs for people who work in warehouses. Now I'm only 16, I know some programming, but not enough to \"run with the big dogs,\" haha, so, I'm usually just testing the programs checking for bugs when I'm assigned the task to do so.\nBut to cut to the chase. Lately work has been super slow. Since we have massively released a bunch of new versions of the program and now we have to wait for the programmers to finish the next update. Now I've been sitting, doing nothing for about a week. I ask for work, and they have none for me.\nMy question for you guys, is what is what is something i could do to pass time faster? (Or just pass time in general.)\nMy mom recommended I learn programming more so I could possibly help the company in the future. It sounds like a great idea, but I'd like some more ideas. Thanks!\nAlso, any idea is a good idea! ",

We then start moving artifacts or even entire structures to this location, at which point replications are created by 3D printers and sent to museums for mass consumption. I was thinking something like [St. Helena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Helena): isolated, dry, small population, and few natural disasters. This could then become an UNESCO controlled area to allow for international studies to be conducted in peace. ",

Fox News is .. nuff said. Al Jazeera America, CNN International and BBC World News do a good job with international news but again, when it comes to US news it tries to do the exact opposite of \"independent\" media and just report on things without context and without perspective because they are afraid of alienating American viewers by having the audacity to maybe say something that an American watching might not agree with. \n\nAnd the New York times? The paper of record is trying to stay in business by growing ever more sensational by the day. \n\nI've just had it. I don't believe in heroes and villains, i believe in shades of gray and complexity. I don't believe \"both sides are the same\" and \"just as bad as the other\" because that is a stupid oversimplification of things. I don't care about the latest gaffe, I'd rather know more about their positions, policy and history and if any promises made can actually get through congress and be upheld by the supreme court. \n\nI believe conspiracies are lazy and dangerous but the solution to them spreading is not to believe that the opposite of what they are saying is by default true. \n\nI'm just sick of all of it and even sick of myself because I participated for so long in stupid internet comment wars and confirmation bias. Sick of Reddit's hivemind but also sick of the anti-hivemind that believes that believing in the opposite of what the hivemind believes in makes you better. \n\nAnd I'm sick of people with rich vocabularies showing off their mastery of the English language while saying absolute nonsense.\n\nSo yeah I guess this turned into a rant of how I want another reddit to take place of the reddit that exists but it would only become the reddit it is now again. \n\nBut yeah what the title says.

            "selftext": "I was thinking about this on the way to work earlier.  The reason it came to mind, and I'll elaborate in a second, is because I have some severe depression and anxiety issues.  I have problems remembering to take my meds and sometimes just don't want to.\n\nSo I started thinking.  They make pumps for pain killers and insulin, as well as implants for birth control.  Why can't we make something similar for people taking other kinds of medications?  But I don't mean just any medication, because I'm pretty sure doctors don't just want to implant anyone with anything, especially if it's not a serious or constant issue.  But here is what I was thinking.  I'm not a scientist, an engineer, or in any position to really know if this is plausible, but that is what I am wondering.  If it IS possible, I think it could help a LOT of people.\n\nWhat I was thinking:  pump or implant that works like the pain/insulin/birth control method but is instead a medication like an anti-depressant, anti-anxiety, or anti-psychotic.  Although, to be fair, it could potentially be any kind of medication that needs to be administered on a regular basis.  Obviously this means the patient would have to go back to see their doctor every month or as needed per medication for the obvious refill and a health check.  I am also aware that all medications are not created equally and just because you can administer insulin or a pain medication over time, doesn't mean you can do the same for mental illness related medications.  (I'm not saying you can do it one way or the other, as I'm curious to see if it's actually plausible.)\n\nI can see some benefits and some drawbacks though.\n\nBenefits: don't have to worry about forgetting to take your medications and risk a relapse, less chance of suicide or attempts at suicide through said medications, possibly extend the gap between relapses, and I'm sure there are more things I'm not thinking of right now.  I happen to be at work and writing this every chance I get a moment of peace.\n\nDrawbacks: people could go nuts and try to remove it themselves (I'm sure most wouldn't but at least I thought of this possibility), some people and some medications don't mix well so you run the risk of having to constantly up or lower dosages or completely change the medicine every time you have to adjust the medication of the patient, there is no option to forgo your medication (for drinking, or whatever the reason a person might not want to take their medication for that time period), and I'm sure there are more if we look deep enough.\n\nWhat do you guys think of an idea like this?  I expressed the idea to my nurse supervisor (I work in a nursing home) and she seemed genuinely interested in how that would work.  I reached out to a friend to get a second opinion on it and he said that if it was a plausible idea, they would already be marketing these things and the fact they don't means it's not possible.  I'm assuming they don't exist yet, but I could be wrong.  Heck, someone else might have posted this idea before and I'd be an idiot for not researching that more thoroughly but I'm quite excited by the idea of it all.\n\nAny thoughts?  Is this a plausible idea?  A really bad one?  I'm just curious what everyone thinks of such an idea.  I'm well aware some people will probably just say, \"People have managed by with just taking their pills for years upon years, this kind of technology would be lazy\".  But I honestly believe if something like this existed, people like me, (who have a serious issue remembering to take their medication or don't really want to swallow those pills) would have an increased chance of being on a routine schedule.  But this is just an idea I had while driving.  I'd love to see something like this come to fruition if it hasn't already, but I'll survive if it's just a pipe dream.\n\nThoughts?",

So you might open the app, and you'll see various people and what they would like to do, and you can swipe right/left to like/disregard. A match would open a chat dialogue.\n\nI know specifics needs to be fleshed out like how to deal with creeps and if there could be a simple personality matching algorithm, but i was wondering if the basic problem is relevant (I want to do something now!) and the solution is practical.",

To make sure the account doesn't generate duplicate sentences, it would post them from a procedurally generated list (that would always be 100000 or so sentences ahead of the account.) that goes like:\n>aaaaaaaaaa\n>aaaaaaaaab\n>aaaaaaaaac\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Obviously, it would take decades for a computer to generate every sentence possible, given a character limit, but I think it would just be a fun little project to laugh in the face of people who say things like, \"the tune in this music sounds similar to the tune of this music made 60 years ago!\")",

Listed below is a break down of how switching to an LED system can save you money, as well as a host of other benefits.\n\n \n1: Use duration:\n\nOn average, LED lights themselves provide light up to 50 times longer than a typical incandescent bulb used by traditional fixtures. Estimated life span of an LED when used for 12 hours a day, is around 11 years of use . The savings on replacements will quickly return the investment.\n\n \n2: Extreme efficiency:\n\nThe Energy conserving LED fixtures will have a higher upfront cost, but will pay for themselves within two years . LED lighting requires only 6-8 watts of electricity to generate the same amount of lumens that a 60-watt incandescent bulb produces . This in turn reduces energy and product costs.\n\n \n3: Better for the environment:\n\n30 LED products emit about 451 pounds of C02 per year, compared to incandescent, which produces 4,500 pounds of C02. The longer duration of LED technology keeps it out of landfills and reduces materials resource consumption .\n\n \n4: Better for your bank account:\n\nAverage costs per year equal on a 30 incandescent bulb equivalent are approximately $32.85 for LED fixtures versus $328.59 for typical incandescent use . Added together over the course of the lifetime of the fixture, the savings are substantial.\n\n \n5: Incentive and rebate programs offer increased value:\n\nAs an incentive to drive the implementation of LED in place of low quality lighting, rebate and incentive programs offered by DLC sponsors encourage the installation of LED and other Energy Star certified fixtures in place of traditional ones. Retrofit kits are also available for if the property owner does not wish to reinstall existing fixtures .",

Essentially it would be like an interactive time machine with markers indicating every action and location captured on my phone (when and where photos were taken, when and where a video was watched, when a where a call was made, etc). I'd personally coin it Project Slipstream since it acts more like a vapor trail that follows you around.\n\nSecond, is taking all of that data and making it easily searchable by context.  \n\"Ok Google. When did I last call my mom?\"  \n\"What was the name of the last bakery I went to?\"  \n\"How much did I pay at the bookstore?\"  \n\"Can you share with dad the driving route I took to get here?\"  \n\"Please replay the last tutorial YouTube video I watched.\"  \nAnd so on...\n\nAll that data is already there and integrated. Why not make it available to the end user? I tend to do a lot of detective work through my history when it comes to these sorts of things (my horrible memory contributes mostly to the problem). I just wish there was an easier way. \n\nI can flush out more details if there's any real interest. I've been wanting this for years. But is it an invasion of privacy? Creepy? Just plain dumb?

            "selftext": "I got inspired by the thread discussing how a judge has ruled: \"compete with Uber or die\". What if we go to work in \"School Buses\"? You would open up the app and input the where you live and where you work and get assigned a \"School Bus\" to get there. After you input the locations you enter the hours, and you commit to pay a regular weekly or monthly fee for this daily ride of Monday to Friday. It will pick you up at the almost exact hour every time, and you will always be able to tell when will it arrive since you can monitor your bus through the app -this will help with traffic delays. It's not a big car or even a van, it's an actual bus, and since it is being paid daily by many people at a higher price it may be more comfortable than mass transit regular bus. It may have amenities like a little vending machine and cushioned seats. If you anticipate with enough time, you can ask to be put on an earlier bus, or a later one since there will be other buses going around with some free seats. Of course you can rate the driver and the cleanliness of your bus every time you take a ride, thus keeping the high quality of the ride. \n\n\nThe price would be between a mass transit bus and an uber x ride. An added benefit is that you help reduce traffic in your city, all while you pay an affordable daily ride. The ride itself is a mini bus, sort of like [this one](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/50/ADG-HX6JHAE-Kanachu-Chi110-Eboshi.jpg). It should be enough to carry more people than a van, but not so big that it can't enter narrow streets. Of course this prepaid routes will be most demanded on rush hours, in the meantime the minibuses might work on other modalities like transporting people on-demand on semi-fixed routes. Probably drivers would best be paid on a fixed income with bonuses, and they will still give a good service thanks to the ratings and general feedback from the public.\n\nI know Uber and other apps are experimenting with \"bus\" rides, though they are not actual buses they are car pools, and they don't work on a fixed prepaid route they are working on-demand all the time. This coupled with the lower capacity of the rides will always force the price to be above the fixed minibuses.\n\nAlso as it happens with other app services this is not targeted towards everyone, it is for office workers which rather have the conveniences of the minibus than to actually go and take mass transit bus on a bus stop. It is kind of a premium service with an affordable cost.",

            "selftext": "So I've been thinking lately about how cool it would be to pass a journal around the community for people to write/draw/put things in from all across the country or globe! I would ask that you would take up no more than a page per person so that we can maximize the amount of people who could participate! This could last a year or as long as it takes to fill up the journal. Then, when it is completed, the last person would then contact me through email/Reddit/some other source so that they could ship it back to me! Once I get it back I would post pictures of journal entries, drawings, and other neat stuff done by you guys! I'm not opposed to it traveling internationally as long as those outside of the USA either: 1) write in English, or 2) write neatly enough that I could have someone translate it. I'm not sure how we would choose who gets it after the first person but if anyone has any recommendations please comment or message me! I hope you guys like this idea!",

Organisations who help shelter and employ the homeless are a more vital solution.. But here it is:\n\nPeople of a certain region/borough/town/etc. sign-up to a website and give an open-ended amount of money into a total pot every week (if they so choose). This is typical charity for those donating - nothing else needs to be done.\n\nThe donated money is transferred every week to a centralised location in their region - shop/church/community centre/etc. Obviously they would have to agree to partner.\n\nHomeless people register for the service on an individual basis - nothing more than a photo and name on record, which is stored for reference at the pick-up location.\n\nThe money itself is divided across however many homeless people register. For instance, if a local area donates \u00a344 in one week, a total of 4 registered homeless people would receive \u00a311 for that week.\n",

            "selftext": "This idea struck me as I was hiking out in the woods on some trails and didn't have my headphones with me. \n\nI've always been pretty tough on smokers. My mom has been a lifelong smoker and her smoking in the house when I was younger caused some health issues for me. So I've always been kind of contemptuous of smokers and didn't really understand why they continued to smoke, despite the health detriments and years of medical research.\n\nSo here is the lightbulb: what if we suddenly found out that listening to music caused cancer and increased risk of heart disease? Something that you've done with your friends for years, a way that you've bonded with people, you now come to find out that it's really really bad for you. Would you be able to just stop listening to music? How would you feel about people giving you stares as you sit on a park bench with your headphones on? Or with your radio playing in your car? You now have to stand 50 feet away from entrances of buildings when you listen to music as well, because the risk of secondhand music listening is so high. And when you go to a bar, where they used to allow music and you used to listen to it with your friends, most of them are prohibited from playing it. In fact, the music listening sections in restaurants are now almost all gone as well. \n\nThinking about this scenario has shifted the way that I think about smokers. Because smoking has, on top of the social dependency, a physical dependency as well. If it would be extremely difficult for me to quit listening to music, something that I enjoy doing, something that relieves tension, etc. then how difficult would it be to quit something that does those things for people, AND is physically addictive as well?\n\nI have less sympathy for younger people because they have always known it was harmful and make an active choice to engage in the activity already knowing the risks. But the older folks that didn't know any better, my thoughts have shifted pretty dramatically. ",

            "selftext": "1. Always have a sidekick.\n\nIt's easy to be brave when you are not alone. This might be one of the truest things I have ever heard. Any success story, any great achievement, pretty much anything at all that has ever been done that carried any value and you can be sure of one thing: It was not done alone. It's not that you just need help getting shit done, but that when your life requires you to be brave - and it will - it is always easier when you have a partner in crime. Community makes you brave. So build community.\n\n2. Always give more that you take. \n\nIt is easy to be brave when you know that you've spent your time giving more than you've taken. You build allies with every generous act you make and that draws people to you. I believe that when we build up those around us we are in turn building up the team and support we need to face our battles head on. When we do the opposite and spend our time tearing others down in an attempt to get ahead, we inevitably isolate ourselves. And isolation, my friends, is one scary place.\n\n3.Have a plan. Then run like hell.\n\nI believe that we have been taught our whole lives that we should do this the other way around. We are told that if you want to get ahead, if you want to succeed and have all the glory then start running the race now and figure the rest out as you go. When you are scared, push someone down in front of you and run right up their back. That way you get all the credit, all the reward and all the praise. The problem with this though is that the moment someone else has the chance, your going to be the one flat on your face. So, think smart and give yourself time to strategize. Create a plan. It's ok if it isn't perfect, just make sure your plan has a direction. No one expects you to have it all figured out, but at least know which way you start running.",

            "selftext": "Hi.\nI've been using a lot of public transportation this year, and I had an idea to optimize inter-city bus lines.\n\nI live in a relatively small country. The way it is at the moment is that you can take the bus to get from one city to an other. They work just like any regular bus line. They have their list of stops where the driver is obliged to pass, and when somebody needs off, they hit a button to let the driver know.\nIt makes perfect sense to go through multiple stops inside the departure city, but going through stops in the destination city is a waste if nobody needs off. They are offloading-only stops. Unfortunately, there is no way to shave them off the route at the moment.\n\nThat's the issue I'm trying to solve here.\nBy letting the passagers communicate their desired bus stop to their driver, he can optimize his route.\nLet's take this a step further, and make it easier for both sides:\nLet the passagers use their smartphone to mark which stop they want. This information sent to the driver's smart phone, which displays an optimal route for him. Free GPS navigator! :D\nIt is possible to implement this. But before going in to implementation, what does reddit think about the idea?",

I'm doing a project for my Engineering Development and Design class and I would appreciate if you could give me feedback and complete this survey (link at the bottom). The problem we came up with is that while exercising, your electronic device battery loses battery faster since it heats up more. Our solution is to make an armband that can charge your phone through kinetic energy.

This would go well for those who are accustomed to eating with spoon and fork in meals.

I am trying to figure out if others think that the idea will help them out too, or if I should go ahead and bin it :) \n\nI've named the app Arrival Buddy. The app simply notifies you about your upcoming stop on public transportation, based on your GPS location instead of an estimated time of arrival. \n\nCheck out the description here, and if you'd like to download it for free, once it's out, sign up on the following landing page: http://arrival-buddy.launchrock.com/\n\nNote: This post is intended to validate if there is a demand for the app and if people think it could be useful. I hope it doesn't qualify as spam or if I've posted it in the wrong subreddit.",

It was revealed this week that AVG, the free anti-virus software, will begin to sell users' browsing history (along with other types of data).  From AVG's perspective, this will allow them to continue to offer their product for free.  Other free services, such as Facebook and Google, engage in similar practices.  However, this practice is arguably a violation of privacy unless the consumer is made aware of how their information is being used.  The public's reproach of this practice indicates that many consumers do not feel they are being treated fairly.\n\nMy idea is to enable consumers to embrace this market for themselves.  Cut out the middleman. Instead of creating a free service that entices users but surreptitiously gathers and sells their information, I would create an app that openly and transparently gathers users' usage information. That would be its sole purpose. I would sell this information to advertisers, the government, and whoever else is in the market for this stuff.  Of course, any information that can specifically identify the user would be scrubbed, which is consistent with current market practice.\n\nThe proceeds of such sales would be passed back to the user.  I'd cut them a check every month.  I would retain a small percentage.  \n\nI, for one, would willingly sell my data for a slice of that advertising money. Would you? ",

Even if an organization is able to do this, they will likely have a difficult time remaining price-competitive against Comcast or Time Warner afterwards.\n\nContracts for using these cable lines could be auctioned off to companies who wish to enter the market. The contracts themselves could be written to prohibit any mergers or buyouts from Comcast or Time Warner (or their subsidiaries). Contract periods would have to be relatively long to prevent annoying service delays (10 years for example), and contract renewal eligibility could be determined by customer satisfaction, prices compared to the rest of the country, service uptime, etc. \n\nThe end game of this would be to provide local communities nationwide with real, better alternatives to Comcast and Time Warner.

Do you think it has a potential? any ideas for improvement? **Would you want to team up and bring it to life as a start-up? Mainly I am looking for someone to make a video pitch, if you are interested, please send me a message.**\n\nThank you so much for any comments/questions regarding this :).",

He'd go to that website for that.\nHe'd select cities which has available real estate, and filter by the ages of 18 to 50 (likely ages of car owners).\nHe can then divide this number by the amount of existing garages in that city, and thus estimate how many cars he can potentially service in that city. The higher the number (because the car to garage ratio is higher), therefore less competition exists, and his business is more likely to achieve success.",

Reddit seems like a great place for this.\n\nFor example, let's say I'm a programmer who is trying to learn french, and another user who speaks french and wants to learn how to program. The idea is to make it easy for two people like this to get together and learn from each other. No monetary cost, no bullshit, just people helping each other out.\n\nWhat do you think?",

I saw it years ago in *New Scientist* magazine, and I always thought it was a good one, but it didn't seem to catch on.\n\nStep 1: Abolish all patents on medicines. Medicine would become un-patentable, like software or mathematics.\n\nStep 2: Establish a global fund, paid into by governments, and administered by a global organisation such as the UN or WHO.\n\nStep 3: Set targets and rewards for creating new medicines, like the X-Prize for space innovation. The size of payouts would be scaled according to both the difficulty and urgency of the problem. Payments would be given to the first person/corporation to create a treatment which meets the criteria (obviously, there'd need to be an independent body in charge of clinical trials to determine if a new drug actually did what it claimed.)\n\nThis would have various beneficial effects: It would refocus research onto the problems which are most pressing to public health, rather than those which would be most profitable for private capital. It would allow any company to manufacture drugs and sell them as cheaply as possible, or empower state-run healthcare providers to make their own drugs, rather than paying the huge mark-ups currently charged by many patent holders. These savings would help pay for the prize fund.\nAlso, it would put an end to the practice of expending time and effort researching new drugs which are no better than existing ones, simply because the existing drugs are patented by a rival company.",

            "selftext": "After connecting to your bank accounts and setting short/mid-term saving goals you have (i.e. $500 for Coachella, $100 for new shoes), you commit to bite-sized weekly saving challenges such as \"Spend less on eating out\" (than weekly avg), \"No spend on coffee\", etc. The app automatically tracks your progress (thanks to auto-categorization of transactions). You can see how much you end up saving from each challenge.\n\nIdeally, the money saved would be automatically moved from your checking account into your savings account right in the app (created for free, with interest, through a partner bank when you sign up for the app). And you can allocate your savings towards your goals however you want, and withdraw to checking when needed.\n\nIn the future, the app would surface up smart contextual saving challenges based on your habits. For example, one weekend, you might get challenged to spend less than $200 because that's what you've been averaging the past two weekends. Or on a Thursday night, you might get challenged to not order any food because you tend to order pizza every Thursday night.\n\nThe core idea is that people often don't know how to even begin saving, so the app would provide little achievable steps for you to actually get there, with a focus on building better habits. And when you have goals, it makes saving much more motivating. \n\nWould love to hear your thoughts on this idea and where you guys would want to see it go!",

            "selftext": "Have question for you about a product/service idea.\n\nWe are team of 4 motivated young entrepreneurs and our first idea/project is that we want to provide a solution that lowers the threshold for taking action.\nSo for this purpose we want to develop a tool (probably an app) that can be used across multiple platforms (phone, PC, websites etc.) and lets you outsource/automate tasks in the easiest and most intuitive way imaginable.\n\nThis is how it might work:\n\n1. The user records his or her voice via a microphone, makes a phone call, writes a message, takes a picture of handwritten notes, whatever...\n2. Any audio is then transcribed to text or the message can go directly to a virtual assistant, who either delegates or executes on the task\n3. Whatever you communicated by pressing a button could be either be posted as content (whether that\u2019s a podcast, for an audio book, a blog, or social media) or serve as a set of instructions for your agent(s) to further process or take action on, s.a.:\n\u2022 Edit or expand on the message you provided\n\u2022 Perform research or gather information on a topic\n\u2022 Have someone start a crowd-sourcing project on your behalf\n\u2022 Let them handle your online accounts (don\u2019t we all have at least 500?)\n4. You have full control of it from pretty much anywhere, anytime.\n5. Another example would be: I have few laptops and a camera that I don't really use them anymore,  I would want my data extracted and uploaded on a cloud service and then sold on a market and all I want to do is just record a message with this instructions and a pick up place where someone will come pick my stuff and do all the job for me, (extract the data for me, upload it on a cloud, place a post on ebay for the laptops and the camera, sell them and then give me the money).\n\nSome existing products or services that come to mind are TaskRabbit, Evernote, \u201cregular\u201d virtual assistant companies, UpWork, Elance\u2026. But I don\u2019t know of anything that eliminates all the steps you need to take just to do the outsourcing, or at least not in the way I described. Let's say for example UpWork you need to spend like hour before you set up everything after sigh up and then you need to search a guy for every specific thing, we want to eliminate that so you just come to us with a task and we execute it for you and you don't have to look for 5 star freelance because we already gonna have one ready to execute task for us. Also we want to incorporate all outsourcing services in one, so you don't have to think \"I need use UpWork for this or should I use TaskRabbit or some other service\". We want to be a very simple service like telling your friend I need to do this thing and then ASAP that thing is done by the hands of our people.\n\nWe are still in idea developing phase so please every comment, critique, advice is appreciated.\n\nI\u2019m aware of agencies that provide online workforce with management software, but that often means spending large sums of money and hiring people part-time. But the point is the process should be as simple as purchasing a product on amazon.\n\nWhat has kept you from executing on your ideas? Which type of solutions would you be willing to pay for?\n\nPlease share your thoughts.",

That is a lot of energy. It seems like it would be fun if instead of the lightning just hitting the rod (and if it's close, make me jump out of my skin), all that energy should do something. I'm not sure what. Set off spinning fireworks, or cause a barrel of water to explosively vaporize.

            "selftext": "TLDR: \u201cFacecraft\u201d: someone can combine World of Warcraft and Facebook to create a private economy with multiple currencies.\n\nImagine if you will:  You buy this new game called Facecraft and create an account.  You make three characters, a wizard, a fighter, and a custom class that you call \u201cReading Teacher,\u201d because you were, afterall, a reading teacher for 6 years before being laid off last semester.  You log on one evening and go to do a quest which will reward you with some gold and experience with which you can upgrade your character, buy things, and give your character cool outfits, new weapons, or even advertizing space on the server\u2019s \u201cwall\u201d.  One quest you notice is: teach my daughter to read.\n\nOf course, your wizard and fighter characters can\u2019t do this quest, so you log on to your teacher character and read a few of the specifics of the quest.  You get 100 gold after doing a quick phone interview and accept the job.  For one hour of teaching, you get 100 experience and 100 gold.  But you must drive to the student\u2019s house and meet the parents, assess the child\u2019s reading level, design a syllabus and teach an hour-long class twice a week for 10 weeks.  You quickly do the math and realize: that\u2019s 2 times a week x 10 weeks x 100 gold and exp = 2000 gold and 2000 exp, which would put you up to level 3 and get you enough gold to buy that cool flying mount you have seen others using.  Do you do it? \n\nDriving across town seems a lot of trouble, and making a syllabus is a lot of work, not to mention the commitment to 20 classes.  You\u2019re not sure you want to do all that just for some stupid flying mount, which is just pixels on a screen anyway.  So you decline the quest.  But your wife comes into the room and asks you how your job search is going.  You, of course, quickly minimize the game and open Monster.com and point to the resume on the screen and say something like, \u201cI\u2019m just posting some resumes now.\u201d She kisses you and tells you that she\u2019s going to help your mother make some dinner.\n\nBack in the game you walk away from the quest giver and head over to the market place.  In the market, there are vendors of all kinds hawking their wares.  One of them is selling vegetables, real vegetables, the kind you can actually eat in real-life, to anyone who lives in your city.  Apparently he has a small crop in his backyard and you can have them delivered to your house, in an hour.  The cost is 100 gold.\n\nNow why would someone offer to deliver vegetables?  They\u2019re probably not safe to eat anyway if they were grown in some guy\u2019s backyard.  And who knows if he\u2019s a real vegetable seller or just some criminal waiting for you to open your door so he can stick a gun in your face?  He does have a semi-long list of reviews.  He says he\u2019s willing to let you pick your own vegetables from his backyard if you have a reputation of more than 500 with the vegetable grower\u2019s guild.  (Your reputation is 0.) \n\nSuddenly it hits you: Facecraft has introduced a new currency: virtual gold pieces.  You earn gold in the game, and exchange them for real things from other Facecraft players.  Wait\u2014they\u2019ve introduced 3 new currencies: gold, experience and reputation.  Wait, there\u2019s another currency.  What was that list of reviews that the vegetable seller had?  A currency.  So on Facecraft, you have to quest, play, and even work, to build up these currencies so you can do what? make your character look cool and\u2014eat?  What would your wife say about that?\n\nThere are other websites offering to buy your virtual gold for real cash.  100 gold for 10 bucks.  There\u2019s also websites offering to sell you gold for cash.  It\u2019s all too much.  Maybe playing as a fighter would be easier than playing as a teacher.  Or maybe taking that job teaching that little girl how to read suddenly doesn\u2019t seem like such a bad idea, even if you are only earning gold in a game.  Facecraft could be a new economic engine for the new breed of jobless computer owners out there, you think. \n\nLater that night after you eat, your wife asks you what you\u2019re going to do tomorrow.  You think about the quest you accepted and say, \u201cI have to work.\u201d  Your mother\u2019s mouth drops open.  Your wife kind of stops moving suddenly.\n\n\u201cWork, like a job?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just one class, twice a week.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow much does it pay?\u201d\n\n\u201cTen bucks an hour,\u201d you say.\n\nShe shrugs.  \u201cWell, it\u2019s not great, but it\u2019s not horrible.  Where did you find the job?\u201d\n\n\u201cOnline,\u201d you say.\n\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s full time\u2014or part time\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just one class, one student, so it\u2019s part time. Twice a week.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s something.  20 bucks a week is enough to buy some groceries,\u201d she says.  \u201cAnd maybe this website you found could get you more jobs.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d you agree.  \u201cI just have to build up my reputation a little, and more jobs will open up at higher level\u2014I mean pay level, I\u2019m sure.\u201d\n\nShe eyes you curiously at that remark, but doesn\u2019t ask anything more.\n\nLater that night, the doorbell rings.  It\u2019s the backyard-vegetable guy with a bag of food.  You earned 100 gold advance from the little girl\u2019s parents after doing the interview.  He asks you your game name.  \u201cRorax,\u201d you say.  Then hands you the sack of tomatoes, which are slightly small and a little yellow, some cucumbers, which look delicious, and some dirty carrots and potatoes.  \u201cThanks for the food,\u201d you say. \n\n\u201cThanks for the gold,\u201d he says.  \u201cI\u2019m saving up for a flying mount.\u201d He shakes your hand and smiles.  \u201cDon\u2019t forget to leave a review,\u201d he says before walking away.\n\nWhen a bank loans you a bunch of money, but they don\u2019t actually have that money lying around in their vaults, isn\u2019t that like making currency?  Perhaps after relying on the banks for so many years to make our currencies out of thin air, why can\u2019t we make currencies ourselves?  Personally, I would rather deal in a basket of currencies than rely on only one currency, because if that currency fails, I could always use another.\n\nWhat if the website crashes?\n\nHas Facebook crashed?  Has World of Warcraft crashed?  There are glitches, sure, but not the kind of glitch that costs the country untold trillions, like when the stock market crashed in October of 2008.  Besides, its not like a player has to completely switch over to Facecraft for survival.  He can still have a normal job in the real world.  But what\u2019s a job for if not to pay for things, and if you can buy real things in a game, what\u2019s the difference, right? \n\nThe government might have a thing or two to say about it, because it\u2019s awfully hard to tax virtual gold pieces, and how are you supposed to tax reputation or experience?  But when I sell a toy on ebay, the government doesn\u2019t come knocking on my door asking for 20% of that sale either. \n\nFacecraft: a social media tool that lets people play for a living.",

            "selftext": "This may be long, but hear me out. It was an epiphany I had just after getting out of class and getting ready to do some homework.\n\nDuring class, myself and I'm sure others have trouble speaking up. I have pretty severe social anxiety so unless it's a one on one situation my inclination is to simply get in and get out as soon as possible, regardless of whether or not I have questions about the material.\n\nNow, personal flaws aside, I found myself wishing the movie Surrogates had some bearing on real life, so I could attend college via a robot that I controlled from home. I find when I'm in a virtual world, I'm more inclined to ask questions about things that I do not understand and am far more outgoing with people I don't know.\n\nIn light of that thought, I got to thinking what technology we have today that could make something like that possible. We don't have robots we can control from home, yet, but we *do* have very talented game developers who can make entire virtual worlds. What if, instead of robots we built a virtual campus in the style of an MMO; Where real life teachers controlled the Characters (or toons, or avatars) of teachers in the game on a virtual campus you could actually walk around in using your own Student Character. Students could enroll for a monthly fee similar to a regular MMO. Classrooms could be instanced to allow for varying class sizes based upon available teachers and subject popularity. \n\nObviously, this idea isn't fleshed out. Specific systems would need be developed to control chat in classrooms, and more importantly to allow a teacher to interact with students in a meaningful way. Perhaps the game could include support for writing tablets to allow Teachers to write on a virtual blackboard that is displayed to each Student. \n\nOther questions: Do teachers act as GM's or do you have a separate GM team to handle in-game (read: in-class) issues. How are class materials handled (texts, specifically)? Would a 15 dollar monthly fee be enough to cover development costs + payroll of devs + real teachers? Should students be allowed to create their own character name or should names be less anonymous and would allowing people to remain anonymous in an Online College MMO environment open people up to harrassment?. \n\nThat's all I've got for now. I feel like if the right developer took on this idea it could revolutionize the way we learn, both in terms of cost to the government and to the student; not to mention making higher education available to even more people. Folks with social anxiety would have less trouble going to class and interacting with teachers or classmates. The considerably cheaper price of attendance and class materials would allow more students to attend (assuming of course you could set a monthly fee closer to 15$ like a standard MMO), and possibly allow you to hire more teachers per student which should set up the students for success in addition to allowing the teachers smaller classrooms.",

Two people get a lego-scale \"king\", toy catapult, a marble, and a bunch of plastic Tetriminoes (3D printed tetris blocks). And two dice, one standard and one with the tetris symbols and a circle. (the S and Z are the same in 3D so it works). If the characters are one inch tall, the blocks are made of half inch cubes. \n\nThey play on opposite ends of a table or like 5 feet apart on the floor. On round one, each places one of each block and builds a fort for their character. Each round after, they roll the normal die to see how many times they roll the special one. They either get the corresponding block, or if it's the circle it means they can use the catapult. It must be next to the \"castle\", and they're trying to KO the other guy's character. \n\n\n\"But won't the blocks slide apart pretty easily?\" Well... A grip texture would be handy, but it's not supposed to hold like lego. I'd say to design it to slide when on a 45\u00b0 slope.",

On my Macbook I just have to go to settings and switch whether I want my function keys to be the default or the special keys (brightness, volume, etc).\n\n\n\nWhile a software solution in the future would be nice, how about a hardware solution? The FN key would be a toggle. Rather than having to hold down the FN key, you can press it once and it stays down, or press it again to raise it up again. No digging through settings, just a simple hardware toggle. Hope I explained it alright.\n\n",

It took them years to implement things like bluetooth or NFC for wireless transferring, and they let the smartphone market take over. I don't want gimmicky things like a 3D screen, built-in projector, or awful touch screen implementation. \n\n\nI'd like to see backlit camera controls, this would be so amazing at night time instead of having to fidgit around with it. If the backlight was in red that'd be even greater since red light interferes the least with your eye's ability to see at night. An ambient light sensor built in so it can detect when to activate the backlight would be neat too.",

            "selftext": "So we all know that in places that have a lot of rain and wind, umbrellas are generally useless because they:\na. don't cover any body part below your chest\nb. if the wind is powerful enough, they will invert into a cup and you're screwed.\n\nThe first problem I can see is that umbrellas with a \"skirt\", if you will, foing against strong winds, will either flap vigorously and press up against your legs making it hard to walk because of all that air resistance from such a wide impenetrable object wading through wind. To solve this problem it would have to have some sort of metal structure made up of thin metal rods (like the top bit) to support and maintain a clear round structure at the bottom of the umbrella. \n\nThis would mean that when you close the umbrella you're gonna have massive 1.6-1.8m (5ft 3- 5ft 11) rods sticking out of the closed umbrella and the umbrella hook would be somewhere lost underneath.\n\nTo counter that issue, either have a collapsible zig zag structure for the skirt that would allow it to fold invertedly whilst closing the umbrella... or have the inside shaft (... I'm starting to think my choice of wording is gonna bite me in the ass later in the comments) be made of two seperate collapsible (one goes inside another. FML) and so it would stretch for the full 1.8-2m (5ft 11 - 6ft 7) to allow the whole structure to fold and still have the hook sticking out (not that it would be much use because you wouldn't be able to hold it by the hook walking around, but at least there is a sturdy place to grab it from without touching the \"webbing\" of the umbrella.\n\nI've seen a photo online of a Japanese prototype of this, not sure if that example is real or was just built for the picture and has no practical use or collapsibility (is that a word?) to allow anyone to just buy one and take it everywhere. Is this possible? Please weigh in.",

            "selftext": "I'm working towards an idea that involves producing facilities that run exclusively off green energy, and produce food for free for those who need it most. Volunteer hours could be used to educate the local communities and to learn how to grow produce on a small scale for personal use. \n\nBelow you can find a small write up on how the idea works, and feel free to comment me on who may be able to assist me on getting this idea to the masses. This idea is not to make money, this idea is to get food to those who need it most. To work along side of food donation services  , and to operate in places outside of the country that may not even have such a place.\n\n\n\n1.1\n\n\n\nCurrently we face a large spread issue that is gone rather unnoticed to media, or to most people as a whole. Despite the large quantities of nutritional food we can afford, often, most others go without. 805 million people don't have enough food to lead a healthy life, and 7.1 million people die each year of starvation.\n\n\n\n1.2\n\n\n\nMy idea involves facilities that are run to strictly produce organic food for free, using off green energy and volunteer hours. It will open up opportunities to have wear houses like this working side by side with places like Feed Nova Scotia in order to have a steady supply of produce with nonperishable items. It also provides a place for youth to go learn life skills, gain volunteer hours, and help to feed their local community. One could also educate families in developing nations on how to feed themselves, without having to take away for budgeting that could otherwise be used to afford housing. Facilities run in this manner have a 90% efficiency over field crops for water use, and indoor grows allow for vertical development of facilities, as opposed to spreading out. Energy that is put back onto the grid would help to upgrade the facility, or to build new ones, effectively snowballing the idea over time.\n\n\n\n1.3\n\n\n\nThe facility would be run on a donation/electricity production refund check. It would be made with air filtration to eliminate fungi and contamination. LED lighting could be made to target certain fruits or vegetables, as to eliminate unessential energy spent on unused spectrum of lights. Every facility would operate in this manner as to optimize the profits that could be made from growing operations  to afford seeds, water, and upkeep. The end goal is to produce more growing operations, more detail at [1.8].\n\n\n\n1.4\n\n\n\nThe facility will be purchased 100% from the start, along with the required solar panels or wind turbines to do the job, all dependent on where  in the world you live. The facility would be managed by people who already have an idea as to how to operate a growing operation, and educators on how to teach volunteers what is necessary . This way people could get a local sense of  good that this company would be doing for the world, and what it would be capable of doing in places that would genuinely save lives and give a further outlook into education on growing for themselves.\n\n\n\n1.5\n\n\n\nVolunteering is the basis of the company, without them the facility could not operate. Volunteers would likely be pulled from places around  the local communities , and around the areas that they were brought in to help develop. An individual who is retired and looking for a place to spend their time, or a high school graduate looking to put something on their resume. This would be an incredible place to go to learn about renewable resources, helping out the local community, and ultimately save lives. The main goal is to reduce and stop deaths related to starvation and nutritional unavailability. Distribution of food would work also, on volunteer hours or facility owned and operated electric vehicles, designated to bring the food to local distribution centers to be plucked, distributed, and eaten all in the same day. Food can be stored in reusable anti-bacterial plastic containers, washed and reused.\n\n\n\n1.6\n\n\n\nPeople could download schematics for facilities such as the aforementioned, and  operate in a completely transparent matter in the same manner as any facility would operate. Countries that support the idea could invest funding into facilities with the end goal of helping to provide communities that may not have cheap access  to produce, or even in a feasible manner.\n\n\n\n1.7\n\n\n\nThe facility would be run on a donation/electricity production refund check, to be put into a transparent accounting process in a way that shows how money and donations are being spent. Facilities could be built new or old warehouses could be purchased that would be reformatted in a manner that allows for a growing operation to be placed inside and a big enough area to generate power for the facility. The more square footage of light required to grow food the higher the required wattage, but lower cost per solar panel. As most things, costs go down when ordering in bulk.\n\n1.8\n\n\n\nAfter the time and automation is available, a facility such as the aforementioned could be made completely autonomously. using robotic arms and photographic scanning of fruits and vegetables ,  eliminate environmental factors that could otherwise damage crops, or cause issues during production. Driverless cars could allow the facilities to get to a point where food is delivered. It could become as much of a basic human right as gender identification or religious views.\n\n\n\n\n\nLinks for reference:\n\n\n\nhttp://www.gelighting.com/LightingWeb/apac/news-and-media/press-room/press-releases/2014/Japan%20Case.jsp\n\n\n\nhttp://www.solarcity.com/",

You oder what you want and pick it up. \n\nTo break it down further, chefs (for lack of a better term) can post what they have to offer, and the cutoff time to order, and when it will be ready. For example, a mother decides she's going to make some bangin vindaloo for dinner. A few hours before cooking, she puts up a post with the cutoff time and pickup time of 6pm. There  would also be a max order limit so she doesn't run out of ingredients. \n\nCollege kid Carl is in class and has no idea what to eat for dinner. His class ends at 5:30 and the vindaloo is on his way home. He orders 2 servings, to cover tomorrow's lunch as well. He picks up the food and all is right in the world. \n\nThis wouldn't just be limited to families making extra dinner servings. There could be some people who have a bunch of organic hot dogs and could cook it on demand. Or maybe the house down the block from you has Fruity Pebbles and all you want is one bowl. Or maybe you just need one egg.\n\nThe point is, I hate eating fast food, even though I have to sometimes out of necessity. I would love to explore the diverse options my neighborhood has to offer. I don't have any Korean restaurants near me, but I sure would like some Korean BBQ from time to time. Someone's having taco night? Two, please.\n\nI'm sure there are food regulations or licences that need to be obtained. Would it be possible to create a new classification for food? I mean if there are dudes in NYC that can sell sandwiches by parachuting them out of a window, why can't everyday people just share what they're already making for themselves? \n\nAlso, to address the concern of strangers knowing where you live, perhaps you can just set up a meeting place rather than your actual address. Or maybe it runs on a trusted verification system.\n\nI'd love to hear your thoughts, both pros and cons!",

            "selftext": "The Fair Tax that has been stalled in Congressional Committee for years replaces all federal income taxes with sales tax and provides a rebate for those living below the poverty line. A better idea is changing the rate (which replaces the brackets by zip code. By taxing based on a geographic area, instead of based on a class (bracket) the federal government could influence the market in a particular geographic area.The benchmark would be based on the amount spent in a zipcode, and in effect, replace the brackets.\n(Number of brackets) \nFor instance, in a place with a large income disparity like NYC, that nonetheless generates a lot of sales, the federal government could keep the tax rates moderate. Instead of arguing about exceptions and credits, the government could argue about what would be good for the economy of a particular zip code. Regarding purchases on line, I'm sure there are other ideas about this out there, but I'd suggest a standard tax of $1 for each item purchased and considering the tax on the purchases made by the companies that transport and manufacture such goods to be what is owed the fed. (Unlike the Fair Tax usually discussed, I would include purchases by companies, not just purchases by humans.)",

Someone with the surname Moon? *Bad Moon Rising*. It would prefer tracks which are already in your music library, or it could offer you the chance to download them (either microtransactions or a subscription service, or maybe even just torrent them or rip from Youtube or something.)\n\nA naive approach would be to just match track titles and/or lyrics to contact names, but it would be nice if it could use some intelligence regarding thinks like diminutives/nicknames and different spellings, so for example a contact named \"Jon\" could get assigned *Johnny B. Goode* by Chuck Berry, or a contact with the nickname \"Mum\" or \"Mom\" could get *Mother* by Pink Floyd.\n\nIt might also be good if it had the option automatically trim the ringtone to the relevant part of the song, using a kareoke-type lyrics database, so *Jumpin' Jack Flash* would start with the line \"I'm Jumpin' Jack Flash.\"",

            "selftext": "I don't really know where to begin with idea so I guess i'll just set the scene...\n\nYou're at house party (has to kinda be a house party for this to work) and it's great. But there's that one problem, there's one sound system and everyone is gathered around spitting out different songs to play. It becomes almost like a battle of music tastes and ends up being more involved in the music selection than actually enjoying it. So this got me thinking...\n\nWhat if, there was a new kind of music service where you can rent (i say rent doesn't necessarily have to involve money) a DJ for an hour or even night to stream their bespoke set to your party. All you need is an internet connection good enough to support the audio quality and a sound system to play it on. \n\nNow, I know the obvious factors here are cost. Who wants to pay money to listen to music they could play themselves and for free? Well, what if the service was free? And was aimed at new and upcoming DJs who are looking to grow their fanbase. A win win for both parties, right? I'm an amateur DJ and realise that the club scene is not all that accessible to new DJs. This could be the low level entry point for budding DJs which doesn't really exist at the moment.\n\nWould anyone actually be interested in this? I mean imagine being able to select a DJ based off their style, maybe even sets they've done before (via youtube), maybe even a leaderboard which is based off of sets they've streamed to other parties and ratings they've received, making known the times they are available, they can plan the set based off interactions with the prospective party holder to tailor it to their wants, or even request songs as the set progresses?\n\nI know this a bit of a wild idea but i do think it is feasible, and it could potentially ruin a party as not everyone will agree with the music choice. But having a predefined slot where they are designated to play, so you could potentially lineup multiple DJs of different genres to keep everyone happy. In addition, because it's streamed you could have a DJ playing from anywhere in the world as long as the connection was good enough, so no matter what time of day it was (if you were pulling one of those massive all night raves) then you could have coverage at all times.\n\nI apologise that this post is a bit of a brain splurge, and a lot of these ideas would be developments upon something simple to begin with but daym wouldn't it be cool.\n\nFeel free to take my idea and transform it into something real, but please remember to credit me!

            "selftext": "I wish a service existed where i could pay a fee, around \u00a320-\u00a330 a month perhaps, and get access to articles from a bunch of publishers. These would include well known publications, like the NYT or WSJ, as well as smaller one-man blogs/sites like Ben Thompson\u2019s Stratechery or John Gruber\u2019s Daring Fireball. Right now, if i wanted to subscribe to just the 4 sites i\u2019ve mentioned, i think it\u2019d cost me more than \u00a31000+ a year! That\u2019s insane! Realistically, how many people can afford that! As time goes by, there\u2019s an increasing number of quality news sites coming online (that are free). Will the number of people willing to pay hundreds of \u00a3 a year for news subscriptions remain steady for the next 5/10 years? I\u2019m doubtful ! For long term sustainability, surely it\u2019s better for publications to have many millions of subscribers paying a small amount, as opposed to maybe a few hundred thousand people paying a lot of money. No?\n\nSo, let me tell you about 2 key features of this service..\n\n1 - Playlists! Here\u2019s an example: When Android 6.0 came out, i browsed dozens of sites just to find the one or two great in-depth reviews. What if i could just use this service to create a playlist of great Android 6.0 reviews published by all the tech publications that are a part of my subscription. This can be done with any topic, of course. Interested in longform articles about medicine? Great. Just do a quick search of the thousands of user created playlists and subscribe to the ones that you like. \n\n2 - The ability to follow individual writers. So, i\u2019m a big fan of writers such as Steven Levy, Jeff Jarvis and David Grann.. wouldn't it be great if i could create a feed of all their stories, and get a notification when one of those writers posts a new article!\n\nAs well as those two, there could be other things like:\n\n---Custom designs : When you read articles in Pocket, whether it be stuff from the NYT or The New Yorker, all the articles look the same. These sites put a lot of time and effort into the design, layout, fonts etc, so this service/app should allow publishers to customise the look and feel of the content. A NYT article won\u2019t look identical to an article from the LA Times, for example.\n---Articles will be pre-cached, so when you click on something, it loads instantly, and can be read offline.\n\n---Perhaps different pricing tiers. Some publications are more premium than others, so there could be low-mid-top tiers that charge different amounts. So for example, the top tier, which might charge, say \u00a350 a month, would contain the more expensive subscriptions like NYT, WSJ, Financial Times etc.\n\n---The service would share analytics about its users with the publishers. You know, things like your age, where you live, what you work as, your interests etc. \n\n\nI\u2019ve got virtually no knowledge of publishing or journalism, or how the economics of those industries work. So, i accept that what i\u2019m suggesting could be outright impossible ! Nevertheless, as an avid reader of longform articles, if a service like this existed, i\u2019d immediately subscribe! If you think it\u2019s a good idea.. awesome! If you think it\u2019s a shit idea and will never work, feel free to tell me how and why!\n",

Basically we compile a list of garages with bad reputations.  Could easily be submitted by the people who had the bad experience, or found on online reviews.   We purchase, rent, or borrow vehicles with minor or major problems and have a trusted certified mechanic (hired just for the show) to run a full diagnosis of the vehicle and give an estimate about the amount of work that would need done based on parts and labor (Would need to know the garages labor rate). Then we set up the vehicle with hidden cameras (motor/interior/underbody/etc...) to see exactly what kind of work they performed and for how long... At the end of the episode they either rip off the owner of the car and are called out, or they are rewarded with tools or something?  I don't know... ",

            "selftext": "Okay, so I was thinking that a school system that works all year rather than ~10 years on and ~2 years vacation period. \n\nTo explain further, basically each school has it's own 2 set of teachers, councilors, principles, and other important jobs. While one set works, the other is on vacation and vice versa. From this system, each school teaches 2 set of students, meaning students get 6 months of education. (Teachers will have a different schedule.)\n\nThe Summer Students study from January to June. The Winter Students study from July to December. The Summer students will have the same set of school staff, as so for the Winter Students. \n\nI feel like this is a good idea because teachers will have less students to teach, meaning that kids are more involved in their education. Another benefit is that students will have a longer vacation, which will require less (or maybe no) holidays over their education time. \n\nIf students want to drop out from the Summer Session to the Winter and vice versa, they can drop out and wait until the equivalent month and date approaches. For example, if a kid drops out on March 3rd (3rd month of Summer Schooling), they come back for schooling on September 3rd (3rd month of Winter Schooling). However, because of the tight schedule, teachers will have to very similar lesson plans. Thus, in addition to this idea, teacher will have a counterpart teacher. \n\nBoth teachers are selected and put together based on the subject they teach. Suppose the Winter Schooling is in session. The Winter Teacher will teach the class, while in the background, the Summer Teacher can collaborate on lesson plans. The Winter Teacher is payed more than the Summer Teacher because the Summer Teacher is not responsible for multiple task; just lesson scheduling.\n\nTo enable consistency, the two seasons might not have much difference between each other. Both systems have to agree to a set number of holidays (if they choose to do so) and that has to implemented on a fresh year. \n\nSo, fellow Lightbulb readers, do you believe this is a good idea? Any criticism, harsh or constructive is accepted.\n\nThanks.",

I think a technological solution is needed.\n\nMy idea is to develop small swarming drones that could be left in every class room or public place.  They would sit on a charging pad ready to go, and be activated by the sound of gun fire.  They would then launch and go to the location of the gun fire and follow the shooter (moving randomly to be harder to hit).  Once there they would employ a combination of deafening noise and disorientating light flashes.  Well this would probably not prevent shootings, it could buy valuable time for people to escape and for law enforcement to get to the scene.  School officials would have remotes to deactivate them in case of false alarm.\n\nThis is an idea that we have the technology for, would be relatively inexpensive, and could be very effective in minimizing casualties in these shootings.  More importantly, it's something that I think everyone could get behind in this time of polarized politics.",

You send him/her/they to the room via a link and you both agree to a winning dollar value that is awarded to the winner which is chosen by viewers. You both add your PayPal or credit card info and deposit the funds e.g. $100\n\nThe battle consists of as much text as you want, everyone is given battle tools such as video, images, memes and outbound links but you only have a certain amount so you have to use them wisely and it goes comment for comment so you can't just spam.\n\nA timer is set e.g. 3 days and the whole way through viewers can like/dislike vote/downvote each comment and then have the option of voting for the whole battle. \n\nYou can invite friends and in fact are encouraged to. On the home page you can browse battles by their popularity, freshness etc.\n\nInternet Battles can be on anything you want. Terminator Genisys is far better than what Rotten Tomatoes rates it, Pepporni is the worlds best pizza, Justin Beiber is actually a really talented artist, feminists never have a good point etc.\n\nNot only can you invite enemies from all over the net but you can also sign up to be assigned random battles, kind of like debate teams or you can request a battle.\n\nIm actually a mother fucking Marketing Wizard so if anyone technical enough out there likes this idea, hit me up so we can build this shit!",

They have seating no where near a bar as well and we just were going to eat. \nThe place is cool and has great beers BUT WHO DO THEY THINK THEY ARE!\"\n\nClearly, this is not the fault of the bar, but is a legality issue, and her 1 star review should not reflect upon the overall score.  While I can see companies setting up false accounts for upvoting, I'm sure there's different metrics you can use- for example, a review can only be worth 1.5-.5 so it's not like you can make 1 5 star review worth 5000% more than a regular review. \n\n",

            "selftext": "So me and my friend were bored and playing Ping Pong and decided to spice it up like and old couples sex life. So first off you use your hands, and bounces don't really matter. To play someone serves a regular ping pong ball by bouncing it off the ground and hitting it with your hand onto the table. It has to land on the table. If it hits your side of the table the ball is reset and it starts off as if it was just hit to your side of the table. If it hits your opponent's side then they can return it by either letting it hit on the floor ONCE then hitting it back onto the table or spiking it onto the ground to hit it onto the table (Meteor) or by hitting it off of some object other than the floor and allowing it to bounce onto the table naturally. (Tec) everything besides the floor can be used as a Tec spot and Tec spots are able to reset the ball similar to the table. Thats the basic back and forth. Once someone scores three points in a row (Killstreak) they gain the ability to just throw the ball to serve. Your are only allowed to serve the ball by throwing 3 times in a row. Once you either A. fail the three throwing serves thus resetting your killstreak or B. complete the three throwing serves thus scoring you 1 point. You need two points to win. Me and my friend literally just created this and were hoping for any advice for the game or any clarification for rules since I know they are probably somewhat confusing.",

            "selftext": "I have an idea for a website that is slightly different from  micro-blogging or plain blogging sites such as Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr, etc. It is for a site where anybody can write articles, film videos, create art, essentially use any form of art and then post it to the site. Other users (or the same users) may create digital publications (for free) where they use their own works and/or the community's works and add it to the publication. If you do not pay for a premium service, the publications must be free. Otherwise, you may add a price for a user in order for them to read, hear and/or watch it. There is also a more expensive premium that allows the publication (if it is a magazine or newspaper) to be published to iTunes and/or Google Play. Those subscribed to this \"Ultra Premium\" (I'm bad at naming things shhhh) are able to have their consumers vote on them to be published to iTunes/Google Play, and only 10 are allowed to be published. All profits from a publication go 20% to the website, 40% to the editor, and the editor distributes the other 40% between all of the contributors.\nThanks for reading!",

            "selftext": "One of the major procedures that is part of most nutritional balancing programs is the use of a sauna made of three or perhaps four reddish \u2018heat lamps\u2019.  These are large, 250-watt, reddish incandescent bulbs.  (Do not use other types of bulbs.)   The \u2018heat lamps\u2019 are sold at many hardware stores, Cal Ranch on the internet, and even at Walmart.  They are called \u201cheat lamps\u201d, but they emit red, orange, and yellow light, and some near and middle infrared rays, as well. \n            In some cases, however, the sauna is not best.  These situations include:\n1.  I do not recommend sauna therapy for pregnant women, or for babies, or for children under 5 years of age. \n2. If one cannot afford a sauna (about $600.00).  See Sauna Builders for details about buying a lamp sauna.\n3. For shining the light on areas of the body that are hard to reach with the fixed lamps in a lamp sauna.\n4. Perhaps, if one is very debilitated.\n \n            In these situations, the use of a single reddish heat lamp can be wonderful, and even lifesaving.  This article discusses this very simple, yet often very helpful form of healing therapy.\n \n\nCONDITIONS THAT MAY BENEFIT FROM SINGLE LAMP THERAPY\n \n            An isolated reddish infrared heat lamp directed at an area of the body provides excellent and often surprising benefits. Single lamp therapy, in our experience, is simple, inexpensive and safe when properly handled. \n            Conditions that may benefit, often after just a few treatments, include joint pain, muscle strains, skin rashes, acne, boils and some conditions of the eyes, nose, ears and sinuses.  Neck, shoulder, elbow, knee and back pain may also respond.  Bladder and vaginal conditions may also respond nicely, especially when lamp therapy is combined with a complete nutritional balancing program.\n            One patient had a sinus infection that did not respond to antibiotics or to natural healing methods.  She was weak and feverish every evening and had constant headaches.  By shining an infrared lamp on the sinuses for 10 minutes at a time, six times a day, relief occurred in two days with complete elimination of all symptoms in five days.  The patient continued to use the lamp for another two weeks because she said the red light felt wonderful.\n            Relief in one or two days has also occurred in cases of low back pain, knee pain, nerve root irritation and other local conditions.  One can safely shine the lamp on any area of the body in need of healing.  However, never shine it on the head area for more than 10 minutes at a time, and a little less for children.\n            It can also be used on pets and large animals such as horses.  Do not place a pet in a sauna, as animals can easily overheat.\n \n\nHOW IT WORKS\n \n            Infrared energy heats the body from the inside, up to several inches deep.  The heat and other frequencies the lamps offer improve the circulation, hydration and oxygenation, and often disable or weaken harmful microorganisms, including those that cause Lyme disease and many other conditions.  Near infrared also has other healing effects, according to some research.\n            Apparently, the frequencies emitted by this particular lamp are extremely beneficial.\n \n\nWHAT BULB OR GLOBE TO BUY\n \n              Purchase a 250-watt, reddish \u2018heat lamp\u2019.  They cost between about $10-15.00 USD.  Do not use a clear bulb, a halogen bulb or any other type.\n            Companies that make these bulbs include Sylvania, Philips, Havel-Sli, Westinghouse, General Electric, FEIT and perhaps others.  They are all very similar, and any of them are fine.\n            The bulb need not be pure red - the color varies from a yellowish to a deeper red color.  These bulbs are often sold for use in chicken coops as brooder lamps.  They are also used in some restaurants to keep food warm, and they are found in some people\u2019s bathrooms to heat up the bathroom.\n            Also, purchase a clamp-on lamp socket rated for at least a 250-watt light bulb.  It costs about $10.-20. USD and they are sold at many hardware stores.  It should have a guard or reflector and ideally the guard should prevent the possibility of touching the bulb itself, which is extremely hot.\n \n            In America, you may buy a reddish heat lamp and a clamp-on socket at most hardware stores such as True Value Hardware, Ace Hardware, Home Depot, Lowe\u2019s and some Walmart stores.\n            An alternative is that you can buy a lamp and socket for about $30.00 plus shipping from Nikki Moses at http://www.mosesnutrition.com/single-heat-lamp-info/\n \n              In Europe: Here is a website to purchase the bulbs in Europe (220 volt version):\nhttp://www.amazon.co.uk/Eveready-Finish-Glass-Edison-Screw/dp/B005XKIFY0/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&qid=1344334552&sr=8-6\n \n            In Australia: Here is a website to buy a heat lamp in Australia (also 220 volts):\n[https://www.lightonline.com.au/infrared-reflector-heat-lamps/philips-infrared-double-reflector-heat-lamp-250w-red](https://www.lightonline.com.au/infrared-reflector-heat-lamps/philips-infrared-double-reflector-heat-lamp-250w-red)\n \n\nSINGLE LAMP USE      \n \n            Use the lamp five to sixty minutes per session, two to ten times per day.  If you are using it on your head area at all (ears, sinuses, etc.) use it no more than 10 minutes at a time, and a little less for children.\n            One sits about 12\" to 24\" from the lamp and moves the lamp around the area during the treatment.  Allow the area to become as hot as one can comfortably tolerate.   If the lamp is fixed, move the body slightly.  Keeping the lamp on one spot for more than a few minutes causes a slight reddening of the skin that will go away and is not harmful.  You will not get a tan from this lamp.  Do not touch the lamp and do not keep it on one spot if you feel a burning sensation.\n            A simple way to do therapy is to clamp the lamp socket to a shelf and sit comfortably near the lamp so that it shines on the desired part of the body without causing strain.\n \n\nCAUTIONS WITH SINGLE LAMP THERAPY\n \n            * When using the lamp on your head area, use it for no more than 5-10 minutes at a time.  \n            * Move the lamp back and forth slightly or move the body part it is directed toward.\n            * Close the eyes when directing the lamp at the eyes, nose or sinuses. \n            * Do not use the lamp on an injury for the first 24 hours following the injury.\n            * Avoid touching an infrared lamp when hot.  Also avoid placing it on any surface when hot to avoid igniting or burning the surface. \n             * Avoid banging the lamp around and avoid splashing water on it, as these could cause it to break.\n \n            To read more about near infrared lamp saunas, read Sauna Therapy on this website.\n\nSource : http://drlwilson.com/articles/HEAT%20LAMP.htm",

            "selftext": "I'm referring to the whole \"combos = special moves\" thing. A platform game, and many attacks to choose from but not all of them are effective. Each 'bot can defend itself against certain attacks, and also does attacks that can be countered in a special way. \n\nInstead of \"rings\", your character simply heals over time, maybe every step returns 1% health. I dunno, I'm trying to design it so you can walk into an ambush, kick some butts, and walk away sore but still capable of getting away from the next one. \n\nOh, and plot: Windows Cortana gets replaced with a GlaDOS clone by virus, and evil!Cortana uses her 3D printing drivers to build a robot army because *someone's* gotta have a good 3D printer that handles both plastic and metal. ... Or something like that.  Each boss battle is a bot factory, and Boss Bots are immunized to attacks you tend to like and weaker to attacks you don't use often.  \n\nI have 4 characters in mind: One strong guy who can only handle so much button mashing at a time, one fast guy who's not so strong but can handle *really* fast button mashing, one wizard who's not strong or fast but with the right combo can one-shot even a boss, as long as not interrupted, and a cartoony guy who plays like Sonic, spindash and head bopping and homing attack included.\n\nWhy do those character types matter? Well, experience and skill levels. Strong guy is like a standard fighting game character. Fast guy is better for the noob who just smashes buttons because he can do a lot of weak attacks real fast like [Dash Incredible](https://youtu.be/-b5OxLRlBr0?t=143). The wizard is for hardcore players who must master all the moves, as a massive challenge. And the Sonic ripoff, for people who just don't get fighter games yet still want to play. What to use here, I have no idea, maybe a cartoony Parkour kid?",

How you wake up can have a huge effect on your day, so it's quite weird to start a day with annoying, embarrassing, and startling noise. \n\nThere are tons of different tactics alarm clocks use to keep you frightened and annoyed long enough to not forget to get up from bed. Some of them work, but still they work by annoying you and make waking up a huge pain. You know what I mean. Alarm clocks are horrible. \n\nSo. \n\nIf there was a device that\n\n1. Does something that wakes you up without being annoying to the user and others in the same building\n2. Is so interesting or pleasant that you want to be awake to experience it, thereby making it better than turning it off and sleeping\n3. Doesn't rely on the user's discipline or quality of life\n\nthen that device would be the perfect wake up machine, someone would get a lot richer, and the problem of waking up would be solved.\n\nFirst without focusing too much on what's possible or feasible, what kind of device could satisfy these three needs?\n\n",

With these observations in mind, for my first proposal, I propose that the [Albuquerque outreach program be expanded](http://www.abqjournal.com/637298/news/new-outreach-set-for-panhandlers.html), that should anyone catch sight of an unemployed freeloading trophy spouse, they can immediately call 3-1-1 and have a van sent to offer them a real paying job for the day. \n\nWith all this money going around willfully supporting the economy of high maintenance panhandling freeloaders, at the neglect of low maintenance homeless panhandling freeloaders. I also propose that we provide a government certification and training program, where the homeless can better learn more tricks to the panhandling freeloader trade, and improve their standard of living, to being at least on par with the common trophy spouse. Why must they continue to suffer without? This will also have the benefit where homeless haters can stop complaining about the poor being drunk and useless, since nobody seems to care anymore once these drunks panhandle themselves up a bit more aggressively by their bootstraps. \n\nI further that, with a proposal that we return to the good old days of multiple marriages, and we arrange marriages of the homeless and unemployed with the employed spouses, who are married to unemployed freeloading spouses, supporting their drinking and drugging habits as well, and in doing so we can have all of our nation's population of homeless and unemployed supported at a standard of living far higher than what they are currently suffering out in the streets. \n\nThank you for your input. \n\nEdit: **TL;DR** The homeless and unemployed can panhandle themselves up by their bootstraps, to the level of freeloading never-employed perfectly useless trophy spouses, and they will get to enjoy a new found sense of dignity, should they decide to continue the rest of their lives lavishly drunk and useless.

ATMs already have power, most of them are able to be used 24/7, and they're just as common as payphones were in cities. Plus, ATMs have cameras, which can be useful in emergency situations if they need to review anything later, and unlike cell phones, a call from an ATM would be landline and easily traced. Sometimes 911 has trouble tracing calls from cell phones, which can be a real problem.\n\nI guess you could also let people to make non-emergency calls through an ATM, all they have to do is swipe their card and pay whatever the bill is. On the one hand, it might be inconvenient for you (but convenient for them) if they take up the only ATM with a long conversation. But on the other hand, that doesn't seem likely to happen. If anything, they'll just call a friend to pick them up or something. No one's going to use a payphone for regular calls in today's world.\n\nI would think that it'd be easy enough to put a phone and speaker function into an ATM. I guess that's the only downside, your conversation would have to be on speaker.",

            "selftext": "So as an aspiring philosopher I developed an idea for a new religious/philosophical movement based on a previous term no on truly defined or elaborated on. If you could provide me with any feedback, skepticism, or added ideas to the first of my religious essays below that would be wonderful. Now for my idea: \n \tAfter many experiences in relation to spirituality and the deliberations between what is truth and what is false, you are called upon to decide with utmost care the truth of all religion. The subject speaks its own importance; its consequences few and its successes innumerable, the existence of spirituality and faith in the new generation lies in your hands. It has been frequently remarked that religion has been reserved the right to never change, and that change must be made by those much older and devoted; however, through the establishment of solid thought and comprehensive idea, the new generation will determine the societies of humankind and their distinct moralities in faith. If there is any truth in that remark, the deliberation which we have arrived at may be regarded as the era in which faith was remade; and ideas created to act as a new definition and view of spirituality, as is deserved by the general world.\n\n\tThe question must be asked however, with these changes in thought and comprehension be taken as a faith, or as philosophy. The choice is ours in practice, but enlightened will society be if our deliberations lead to a judicious estimate of all our beliefs. So in turn the question is unanswerable until the deliberations have closed and you have decided on how you wish to change. Thus as humans attempting to quantify the entirety of faith we gain power in our choice to convey or withhold our thoughts.\n\t\n\tAmong all the formidable obstacles this challenge presents, our deliberations and their relation to: religious groups, political think tanks, minorities, students, and society as a whole will pose the largest hindrance to the achievement of quantifiable and universal faith. It must be noted this was not designed to prevent others from their practice or in any sense affront the ideas of others, thus our relations to these groups is imperative to the deliberations. I am well aware of the implications of blasphemy, and by design humans act on thoughts of anger towards others be it directly or indirectly. Thus it is imperative that throughout these works our words be chosen precisely and effectively. \n\n\tIn an observation of faith, I have come to many conclusions on the duality of religion. Spirituality is the first piece, undeniably affecting all global societies through its cohesion amongst all people taken as the right side of the dual form; and \fmorality is the second piece, providing the means to justify actions and thoughts throughout the global community effectively the left side of the dualistic form of faith. \nIn this observation, I have concluded that through some odd happenstance, that faith in itself is much more complex than the singularity of a single faith. I will admit I am no expert on theology and my opinions on the subject of religion may be bigoted, but the fact of this observation is irrefutable. Faith is dualistic in nature, the battle between what a divine or arcane power commands, and what is justifiable in humanity according to modern events. \n\n\tIt may be insurmountable to attempt a quantifiable idea where all spirituality and morality agree, but it is human nature to strive for the unattainable. To offer arguments in favor that religion is perfected in its current state, without adversary, and accepted unanimously is illogical. The fact of the matter is faith is manifested into humankind alone thus it is our duty to find a universality amongst all people, and that is the goal of the Omniist.\n\nLet me know what you think, and if the paper articulates a proper introduction to the topic.

            "selftext": "If you love a warm light, you\u2019ll love these LED lighting options\n\"Those lights make everything look blue.\" Ugh. I\u2019ve heard that remark about LED lighting too many times to count. For me, as a designer (aka home-problem-solver), it\u2019s frustrating to hear friends reminisce about how the glow from 60-watt incandescent light bulbs would make their homes look and \u2018feel\u2019 so warm.\n\nWell, LED light bulbs can make your home look and \u2018feel\u2019 equally as warm as those 60-watt incandescent lights. True story.\n\n\nLED Lighting Bulbs Don't Have To Be Blue\n\nLED light bulbs don't have to be blue, there's lots of choices.\n\nIt\u2019s like everything else in the world of technology, there's lots of options with LEDS: variety of color temperatures, dimmability and brightness. There also are more tech specs you\u2019ll want to know about in order to achieve the desired color of light in your home.\n\nThe Tiffany styled art glass floor lamp has a color temperature of 3000k, which is similar to the temperature of the 60-watt bulb.\n\nThe Higher Temperature Means Cooler Light\n\nFor any type of light, the higher the temperature, the cooler the light.\n\nLED lighting is available in a variety of color temperatures. I think that one of the best parts about LED light bulbs is that they have a wide range of color temperature possibilities. And it\u2019s probably the easiest part of tech specs to remember.\n\nIf you want the inside of your home to look like it \u2018used to look\u2019 with incandescent light bulbs, you like the warmer light look, you\u2019ll want to look for an LED that has a color temperature around 2700K to 3000K.\n\n\nLED Pendant Lights \n\n1. [Philips Master Led Mr16 7W 24D Warm White Dimmable](https://www.lightonline.com.au/led-downlights/philips-master-led-mr16-7w-24d-warm-white-dimmable): The color temperature of this Mr16 philips LED light is 2700k\n\n2. [Deluxlite Energy Saving LED GU10 7W Warm White](https://www.lightonline.com.au/led-downlights/deluxlite-energy-saving-led-gu10-7w-warm-white): This LED GU10 light has a color temperature of about 3000k, which is within the expected color range of incandescent bulbs.\n\n\nLED Light Bulbs\n\nLED light bulbs can be used in many different fixtures.\nIf you are shopping for LED lighting, you might start wondering if the fixture has to be under the \u2018LED lighting\u2019 category in order for you to use LED light bulbs. Not true.\n\nYou can update lighting in your home with LED light bulbs. But, before you click on the link and start shopping, keep in mind the color temperature range that you desire. So if you like a warm light like an incandescent, look for 2700K to 3000K. If you want a daylight look, which can be perfect for your Instagram photos, look for 3500 to 4100K, which is in the color neutral zone.\n\n1. LED 7 Watt A19 Non Dimmable Bulb: This little LED light bulb has a color temperature of 2700K and is comparable to a 40-watt incandescent bulb.\n\n2. 12 Watt Dimmable LED Omni Directional Light Bulb: This dimmable LED bulb is comparable to the color temperature a 60 watt incandescent. And it lasts about 25,000 hours.\n\n3. LED 12 Watts BR30 Light Bulb: This dimmable LED 12-watt light bulb is also comparable to a 60-watt incandescent, with a color temperature of 2700K.\n\nFind more [lighting and lamp options on light online](https://www.lightonline.com.au/search?search_query=lighting) now!",

And as usual there are bosses, dungeons and such. But one thing, the final boss (The villain of the games storyline) Will end the MMO, it will be over forever showing the people who completed its names and maybe some sort of price to be had. \n\nNow to combat things like people rushing through and grinding there will be mechanics in place to stop endless grinds from bots and scripts. There will be no Microtransactions, just a single one time purchase price. \n\nNow with the boss (which ill now call X) Will be the toughest thing ever seen, not being able to even be faced or hurt by medium level players, Needing particular sets of gear, having tough mechanics and being near impossible. But still being able to be beat in much much later game...Much...later game.\n\nNow i'm thinking a classic fantasy setting for story with some call twists put in where they can be. The actual game mechanics would be unique, not just a push-key fighting style other games have taken on board.\n\nSo thats a small roughly put together list of my idea, what do you guys think?",

Basically it would be as if someone was sitting next to you helping you focus on the road, but you're talking to them over the phone. Conversations would be very casual. You could request certain voice types or personalities. Maybe this app could even double as a IT help if it offered screen sharing capabilities (\"Hi, how do I change the settings on my phone?\").

            "selftext": "Reality arises from nothing. Reality is infinite. Every possible universe exists. \n\nWe are all reincarnated again and again, and the cycle of existence will always be going on. Everything is balanced, and life is perfect when viewed in its totality, as a whole. \n\nGood and evil exist as universal laws by necessity, because everything is balanced ultimately.\nThere are a number of truths that appear to me to be necessarily true. \n\nThe first truth is that I exist. As Descartes said, \u201cI think, therefore I am\u201d, however, one must define the intangible and indefinite in explaining what thinking is. If I were to try and improve Descartes statement, I would do this by simplifying it to just \u201cI am\u201d. \n\nOne cannot be aware of having made this statement without having to accept it as truth.\nI exist, I am having an experience. In fact, what I call my experience is in fact the \u201cI\u201d that I see as being the centre of my experience. \n\nTo put it another way, I am the ultimate reality, experiencing its self, and while it may be nice to think of \u201cI\u201d as being separate from this or that, from a purely technical, ontological perspective, I am reality, reality is all there ever is. I am what I see, what I feel, what I touch.\n\nThe second truth is that the origin of everything you can know and experience, and everything that ever existed and ever will, comes from the simplest possible thing, or concept, imaginable. The simplest thing that we can think of is emptiness, nothingness. Another way of describing this original state or source would be \u2018pure potentiality\u2019. \n\nThis emptiness potentiates all things. Other names; God, Brahman, The Unified Field (Physics), The One (Neoplatonists), the Singularity. It is a timeless, zero-dimensional point of infinite potentiality. \n\nThis point, or field, (let\u2019s call it The Absolute) is not an event, but rather an originator, or source. There was not a moment when reality came into existence, but rather, reality has always been flowing from this source. \n\nBut what is reality? Since the Absolute is perfect, so is the resulting reality. This is the third truth. Reality is perfect because it is infinite, and because, when it is viewed as a whole, it is unblemished and perfect in every way, totally balanced; materially, experientially, morally. \n\nWhy? Because it cannot not be. It has balance at any level, because it is perfect, and so has rules. If reality was finite, it would be imperfect. \n\nUniversal laws like balance and thermodynamics arise from the fact that (this is tough to explain) reality morphs in a way that is balanced, because it all starts with zero. So if everything, all the negative and positive energy, didn\u2019t add up to zero then that would not be logical.\n\nIn actuality, The Absolute can be viewed as the same thing as Reality, but viewed as a whole. Imagine a sphere, perfect and flawless. Now imagine zooming into the sphere, and as you get closer to the surface, you start to see pixels, patterns, then details, universes, stars, systems, beings. \n\nWhat is The Absolute? Is it made of anything? Matter, Energy, Awareness, or something else? It is of course a primordial combination of all of these.  Sort of.\n\nMatter as we know it does not exist except as a phenomenon that we experience. Matter and energy are ways of describing phenomenon; something moves because of energy, something has a certain texture because of the type of matter it is made of.\n\n The whole of reality is made up of an infinite number of bits, which arise from The Absolute. Think of these bits as being like brain cells, they are bits of awareness, and reality is a field of awareness. Maybe matter is a real thing, but everything arises from awareness. \n\nAwareness is not consciousness. Consciousness is, I suppose, awareness comprehending itself, and it takes something as complex as a human to be able to be fully conscious.\nWhen you die, you are torn apart and spread through hyperspace, maybe you will be a chair, or a grain of sand on the surface of Mars. Or a photon flying through space, or a dog, or a black hole. Smoke weed every day.\n",

(linked to family member by fingerprint reader, optional electro-magnet lock, similar to office doors so if you HAD to get into fridge killing power would unlock it)\n\n\n- Tell you when an item is about to run out (based on weight and bar code scan in/out), multiple items removed and returned at same time can be averaged based off of the portion size.\n\n\n- Have an \"order more food\" mode/button where it will send a request for more food to grocer based on what you are out of and your location to said grocer. Additional revenue streams from selling subscriptions to grocers or selling them software to receive orders. \n\n\n- Provide statistics like most popular items, average food spoilage amount estimated costs in spoilage etc. Recommend sizes based on consumption (your last gallon of milk went bad with 34 oz of spoilage, we suggest purchasing a half gallon).\n\n\n- Provide suggestions when shopping to help you eat better or save money (think diet mode, it will switch from butter to margarine or coke to diet coke.)\n\n\n- It could calculate the optimal temperature based on food in fridge and what temperature it keeps best.\n\n\n- It could have self diagnostics where it will call a repairman/woman if it detects a problem.\n\n\n- It could also maybe have a monitor with a list of suggested snacks/meals along with a recipe on the front, this could change based on time of day\n\n\n- There would of course be a mobile app where you could manage your fridge.\n\n\n- It would be able to lock people out based on diet or time of day.\n\n\n- You could also monetize suggested items based off of food consumption, like ohh we see you like coke we think you will like advertisers cola, here is a coupon for some and we added it to your grocery lists, which we just sent over to your local grocery mega chain that \"integrates\" with your new fridge will you be picking it up or would you like it delivered for an additional $19.99.",

            "selftext": "Let me see if I can make this sound a bit less crazy. First, some economic background.  \nThe whole reason the government gives territory out to people to own is based on [the tragedy of the commons.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons) Basically, it means that people are greedy sometimes and that this greed can hurt everyone if the gains of an action are direct but the losses are socialized across lots of people. Even if the losses outweigh the gains, people will still do the thing that hurts them because it doesn't hurt them specifically.  \nThe best example I've come across for this is a public pasture that is overgrazed until it is worthless because nobody stands to gain from it's preservation. A way to counter this is for the government to give everyone some private part of the field to take care of, so they will have a direct incentive to not overgraze their section. As a result, the entire society is richer.  \nWe face a similar problem to the pasture in the modern world. Nobody likes bothering to invent more efficient, eco-friendly cars, or cleaning up the cyanide that they put in a river, but if nobody does these things society is poorer and less efficient as a whole. Countries as a whole refuse to carry out their promises to enforce international ecological regulations because although it would benefit them to live in a world where the environment is relatively clean, it would benefit them much more if every other country did their part, but not them. (and as a result, nobody does their part. Analogous to overgrazing.) If only there was an analogous \"let the people take care of the pasture themselves\" solution to this tragedy of the commons.  \nThis is that solution. Convince every country to affirm an international contract designed to give every human the legal rights to one 'human' of air, ocean and any other resources not currently privatized yet subject to pollution. (low earth orbit is becoming cluttered with space debris, why not privatize space a bit? It would encourage private exploration and utilization of the heavens.) A 'human' of these resources is a shifting quantity of N / A, wherein N is the total quantity of these resources available and A is the current legally recognized population of earth. This asset would, of course, decrease in value as the population grows, but that is beside the point.  \nNow what? Well, since these resources now belong to citizens, other people polluting these resources to the detriment of the owner is an act of aggression, and act of vandalism. A clause in the international contract (let's call it \"environment privatization act\") provides that those who pollute the privatized resources must pay for the damages that could be incurred- whether the damages occur or nay. Putting cyanide in rivers means a tough fine for polluting the property of another individual, so people do that less. The fines negotiated in the contract are much sharper if the damage is not disclosed; and conversely if you cede that you are putting tons of smoke into the air you won't have to go to court for a year, instead you will just pay a fine to all the people who have had their air vandalized. Before the fines go to pay individuals who have had their property vandalized, though, some of it goes to pay individuals who have attempted to stall the negative effects of the vandalism- people who plant trees and buy land in the amazon rain forest to protect it receive a bonus for their passive resistance of damage to other people's property, in the same way that a small town might reward an individual who filtered cyanide out of their water supply, or a police department would pay an individual who stopped a crime.  \nWho would support such a crazy idea? Well,  \n-socialists, because suddenly lots of people get resources that they can't lose or sell off at a loss. People who are in impoverished neighborhoods could even survive off of the fines on their share of privatized environment, if the worst came to worst. People in third world countries would find this to be quite a blessing if they got some small passive income.  \n-libertarians and anarcho-capitalists would support this contract because it places the environment in the hands of a clever private sector now rededicated to the well being of the humans in general, while largely outside government control.  \n-environmentalists would support it because it places an objective global standard for law regarding pollution, and would decrease pollution to some degree.  \n-the businesses that pollute might support it because it would probably rid them of the risk that plagues their industries the most: the threat of overcompensating drastic environmental legislation taking away their industry completely and making all their skills completely useless. Sure, they would have to halt growth and their stocks would lower in value a bit, but it would provide tons more security.  \n-I dunno what conservatives and liberals in general would think of it. I guess it really depends on to what degree they believe that this is good move on a personal basis.  \n\n\n\n\n\nIf this all sounds too miraculously good for you, remember that this move would, on the whole, actually passively create wealth for all of society by eliminating the tragedy of the commons that currently plagues the allocation of these resources. This wealth created by better selfishly selfless coordination of resources is flowing out to the world through these fines and the reduced pollution.  \n\nPlease submit your criticisms below, thanks!",

But I just can't get it out of my head. \n\nSo here's the idea: when we (humans) recover from sickness, our immune system basically \"learns\" from the experience and keeps on-hand a record of how to deal with that particular infection again, right? \n\nWell, what if we could digitize that? \n\nIf immunities could be digitized, then the logical conclusion is that they could be shared between people over the internet, and the logical conclusion of THAT is that we (humans) never experience a pandemic ever again. \n\nImagine a world where as soon as 1 person finishes recovering from a cold, or the flu, that person could share his immunity with the world at almost zero cost, and that immunity could spread virally around the world in the blink of an eye. Imagine a world where if any single person ever manages to miraculously recover from a disease then we ALL as a species become resistant to it, no matter how pernicious that disease may be. Imagine a world where a disease with a 90% mortality rate means that worldwide 10-100 people die from it instead of thousands or millions. And then we're all immune.

At the moment the fastest theoretical speed is 7Gbps with eight 160MHz channels which are capable of about 900Mbps each. Li-fi is a recent-ish technology that uses light intensities to transmit the bits. Max bandwidth that scientists fro Oxford have gotten is [**224Gbps**](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?reload=true&arnumber=6967750) which is huge amounts of data. But the big limitation of the two technologies is that they only measure two thresholds: **1s and 0s**. What if the data was not only transmitted by way of light intensity but also at the same time transmitted in different colors it would result in more combinations than just two. In all demos of Li-Fi they are only using one color: white. When in reality RGB LEDs can transmit 16,777,216 combinations of red, green, and blue. **Which you could use to transmit more information per signal.**",

            "selftext": "One problem with Wi-Fi is the existing overlap and interference with other Wi-Fi networks in the area. This mostly happens in medium to high density areas and what ends up happening is that there is a lot of bandwidth being wasted. To combat this we have created a larger amount of channels but eventually they will interfere as well because the new channels will be adopted more sooner than expected. The idea that I have is that we gauge how much signal we should be pushing into each direction. Such as up and down. In an apartment, most likely you will only have one floor so it would be largely unnecessary to have any of the signal be going up or down. Also you don't need the network to span all the way to the other side of the building if you are only going to be using a small section of it. So it would be like fencing the wall off to only be used for that one room. The Wi-Fi signals could hit the wall and if it is detected then it would lower the amount of signal in that direction to an amount that wouldn't allow it to go through the wall. Obviously this could be a setting that could be turned on or off because this wouldn't be practical in every setting. Such as low density or rural neighborhoods. ",

Raiding parties tear up subs they don't like, down voting new posts for no reason other than malice. People can be very good contributors in one sub but useless or destructive in another.\n\nInstead how about each redditor has a weight applied to their votes. Right now all votes are weighted equally at 1.0\n\nHow about instead of you just poke into a sub without subscribing and start down voting stuff, your votes only count for 0.5 or even 0.25. If you start writing comments people agree with, then your sub weight goes up. You make enough positive contributions and maybe your sub vote weight goes over unity to 10.0. \n\nAlso, each vote you make, up or down, reduces your own weight by some amount. So if you only show up and vote endlessly either way, your vote starts to count for less. You have to keep contributing to keep a high vote weight.\n\nTo take this even further, instead of a redditor having a per-sub weight, I'd like to be able to have my own choice of weights applied to selected other resistors whose opinions I strongly agree with (or not...) so when I view a sub or even front page, I get a view where the posts are sorted by vote counted that are adjusted by weights which are further sub-weighted by my own vote history.\n\nThis way strong post contributors will bubble to the top as they do now, people who write good comments will continue to get viewed, people who do nothing but downvote and whine will just fade to the last packets...\n\n",

            "selftext": "i would get d's in english.. i write like a third grader. so cool.\n\nmy favorite idea was recently i made a skateboard trailer that uses a 'hitch' and wheel chair parts. The rear board can carry 100lb so far. i haven't tried more. I wanted to add a motor before winter and make it a snowmobile with these specialized trucks.. but no money left.\n\nidea two is when you buy large boxes of goods like furniture from ikea could have a set of caster wheels built into items over 50lb. so get home cut the bottom cover to expose the wheels then move that shit.\n\nidea three i thought of while working at target.. you get box cutters at work (the flat pressed metal) I would take left over magnets from the apple display and combine the two. i would then take the magnet boxcutter and place it in my pocket and slap a regular one on the out side. easy access and when when the blade goes dull i'd just switch them out. also i was thinking of a magnetized blade lock when the two touch to make it safer.\n\nfourth idea was turning a treadmill i got out of the dumpster recently to make a ski lift next to my home. im learning about electrical wiring motors up now. shits difficult.\n\nfifth idea was to get outdoor black lights and put them on the inside of my jeep grill (i already tried christmas lights.. it kinda worked not bright enough) maybe high powered led lights in the lights on the front too in case of emergency.. also a purple laser bouncing off mirrors on my back rim to make a pentagram. for shits and giggles.\n\nsixth idea was a good michigan joke. michigan people love michigan. you have to see/hear it. cant write it.\n\nseventh idea was a bowl (smoke weed bowl..) an electric powered wax or shatter bowl that would heat its self and not require the big ass butane torch to heat the nail.\n\neight idea was a skateboard insert for the bic lighters so you could turn your lighter into a little tech dech. it'd literally be flic your bic.\n\nanother crazy idea was to hold bank robbery using only puppies. I thought the whole thing out. im the get away driver.\n\nif i was smarter i would built a four wheel drive electric speed cart and put polyurethane skate wheels so that thing could drift. dope.\n\nif i was rich id make a giant foam pit using uv reactive foam so the whole pit would glow. the pit would need a solid roof that would retract like a dump truck to reveal a climbing wall underneath. h.o.a. is really strict here.\n\ni bought an electric wheel chair from a dump for 20$ the dude thought it was a roomba. the wheel chair is missing the chair, controller, and batteries. the batteries are easy to get for free. the controller is another thing. i looked up a controller for 150$ and then ill have to cannibalise one of my r/c cars. and then turn it into the ultimate in town cruzer to the bar. it aint a car, toy, or mobility deviece no d.u.i. itll have skins of lambos and movie cars too.\n\ni know i have some more ideas. I forget things a lot some sometimes. small gaps. so i wanna hear what you think. be nice please, im not mean.\n\nthought of one. a necklace compass that shows north and stuff but when you click it it points to the paired compass. like a compass to her heart. \n\nI have great advertising ideas for arizona tea and jeep/car commercials. I don't know how to make these though.\n\n\n\n",

            "selftext": "So I have been wondering a fair bit about when the United States bailed out its banks and could spend 500 billion in the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008.\n\nMy thought/question is What would have happened to the economy if instead of spending that money to bail out the housing markets and the banks the government directly gave that money to every person 15 and older one payment of about 1900$? That is about 260 million Americans. (as of today's census so it would be a few million lower in 2008) \nI included 15 and older because that's how wiki pedia broke it down and I justified it by thinking  they are young adults and their decisions for what they wanted to do with the money would be quite impactful for the future. \n\nI think that 1900$ to help people and make an impact at the bottom\nWould would been a pretty neat idea. But would the economy still have collapsed? Would we be worse off today if that happened? I have just been reading Act of Congress by Robert Kaiser and was thinking about it.",

            "selftext": "These are a few ideas on AR, also how they could work well in AR.\n\nGoogle Glass, I take most people were not comfortable with the idea of having a camera in their face even if a light indicated that a app was using it. Though, a easy solution would be to block the camera lens with a cover of such, say if it's on the right side and doesn't protrude past the lenses something could slide over it or could be done manually.\n\nHow it works, instead of pulling all the data off the device itself it could offload that data from your phone much like android wear, or was it just the Apple Watch? Basically the app is installed on your phone and it's displayed in front of your lenses.\nThough I'm not so sure of the size of the harddrive that would need to fit the glasses themselves, it would have to remain small for the batteries to at least last for the day.\n\nUseful Apps:\nGoogle Maps, you could have traffic conditions or such displayed to the right or left side out of your main view so it isn't in the way. Also, like Google Maps their was a indoor mapping tool quietly released for the iPhone just recently.\n\nTranslation uses, using the camera you could translate foreign text in front of you or have text appear on your right side field for example translated into text of what the speaker is saying. Not sure how well that would work in a group or if their is a lot of background noise but I think Google actually improved that area just recently as well.\n\nIdentifying objects\nYou could use the camera to pull up information on certain plants your looking at in front of you, or like the details of a pine tree or specific fungus. If it can't a picture could be sent and someone could provide you with more detail.\n\nTracking\nMuch like indoor mapping you could pin a object and track it like a moving car, or bus. And watch it until it too far away to be tracked (Out of distance.)\n\nHeight\nYou could measure the height of object by looking at it or the distance between two objects you could be measuring.\n\nGaming\nWe have already seen a demo of what gaming could do with Magic Leap, if you haven't you can watch it on Youtube.\nThere are also a few other uses along with sports and fitness that I could explain more of if anyone is interested in hearing it.\nSuch as how ar could help you make a better shot, possibly with a accessory that could help measure force of throw and distance in basketball.\n\nWeather\nPretty basic, forecast could tell you your weekend forecast, the current forecast, temperature and humidy, etc. it could even analyze the temperature, or tell you more about the clouds above you which way there going, how high they are, if it looks likely to rain based off those clouds and so on.\n\nHealth\nWell, just like your phone or smartwatch it could display vital signs in front of you. Your pulse, if your running a fever, your blood pressure (with a connected device)\nAlso, I'm not implying that the device itself holds all of this data, the glasses but it pulls its data from a accessory connected to your phone displaying it in front of you.\n\nYou could also ask it questions, like Cortana or Google Now. Or just copy Apple and give it force touch to the right side of the device and give it some option of a 'double click', or force sensitive touch. To zoom in to a object or to pull up more options to be displayed with your fingers.\n\nDrawing and Music\nYou could use it to draw, like a video displayed in front of you, you could follow along or like a piano lesson, each key would highlight and you follow along holding the key for as long as the tutorial says.\n\nJust like fitness and outdoor tracking, you could have a map of the area your jogging on and have it displayed in front of you. Same with bicycles.\n\nI mean you can also 'cheat' with the device, and I'm not just talking about school. I could explain more if you want.\n\nClothing\nWell you could check out what something may look as it would appear on you, though a little difficult it would probably appear as a animation over you, how the fabric turns as you turn.\n\nAlso, with games instead of watching games on your lenses you could play a game and have information displayed in front of you, tips, tricks and so on. Same with TV, I guess. Like say watching a show, actors information could pull up, etc. Director for a movie. You get my point.\n\nWhat other things could be unique to AR? What would you like to see? I could picture different glasses designs but I think Google already partnered with someone for that. I could draw some stuff to show what I mean. Anyway, what do you guys think of AR?\n\nHaha, that would be cool if Google saw this post. If you do, could I work for your team? I know a few more interesting concepts but I don't want to make this too long..\n\nUpdate: I guess I'll update this more later.",

Humorous entries are highly encouraged.\n\nIt would make travelling so much easier, and it could even be useful just sitting around at home (virtual tours and context awareness).

The closest I've found from a brief search is findyourspot.com but it's still a pretty ugly interface with limited variables. How hard would it be to flip the search on realtor.com's?",

But let it be known that the template heavily relies upon Edward Tufte's *6 Fundamental Principles of Analytical Design*, as well as data analysis processes described in O'Reilly's *Doing Data Analysis* by Rachel Schutt and Cathy O'Neil. I have also borrowed (stole) a list of types of data visualization from O'Reilly's *Data Journalism Handbook* edited by Jonathon Gray, Liliana Bounegru, and Lucy Chambers.  \n\nSo without further ado, here it is:\n\nI have been complaining about and lamenting over the world's problems for about five years now. My initial passion to solve global epidemics such as widespread corruption, climate change, and a plethora of social injustices quickly eroded under the sheer overwhelming weight of it all. Rather than accept this dismal state of affairs, I decided to re-examine democracy's current methods of solving its issues, much of which rests upon a functioning fourth estate; i.e. a free press. \n\nIn this post I have collected the ideas I developed in regards to 20th century media's evolution into 21st century, data-literate media. This post and the simple graphic therein represent four years of work. I think I'm finally finished, at least for now, and I'd like to show you what I have. \n\nSociety is at a critical turning point in regards to media and technology. It is time we utilized the internet's full potential in an organized and cohesive manner. A different type of media article needs to be developed that can readily exhibit all relevant information with extensive and interactive visuals. It is now possible to design and implement three-dimensional, multivariate data articles. Data that will explore causality, mechanism, explanation, and systematic structure as in accordance with Edward Tufte's 6 Fundamental Principles of Analytical Design. \n\nData journalism is a field of the news industry that is still in its infancy. Despite powerful tools at our command and the data-rich landscape we now navigate, I believe that we are limited by several outdated ideas of how to relate to information that no longer matches the world we find ourselves living in. \n\nRight now we are being drip-fed information about recurring, global problems. This is a huge flaw in our media methodology. Journalism still relates to information as it is occurring in real time, but does not step back to assemble a complete picture with all the necessary facts. To expect a reader to assemble a complete, comprehensive set of all the facts pertaining to a single issue on her own time is madness. \n \nNothing will be accomplished without an appreciation for the sheer scale of the global issues that beleaguer us today. Very few data journalism articles have grasped the entirety of a single national or international issue. It will be a difficult venture, but one I believe is possible. Developing such a comprehensive product will require far more time and ability than can be delivered in the standard newsroom. It will take months of work and a dedicated team made up of data journalists, developers, and outside experts. The resources required to make this final product mark it closer to that of a documentary. \n\nI have developed a template outlining how a news outlet should go about creating a fully comprehensive visual analysis of all relevant information pertaining to a single national or international issue. I call it [the white template](http://i.imgur.com/xpRy2RE.jpg). \n\nThe reason why I named this concept \u201cthe white template\u201d is because corporate executives use something very similar to what I'm proposing, which is called a \u201cwhite paper.\u201d Since my invention is meant to be used as a sieve of sorts in order to process endemic issues, I have decided to call it a template. \n\nThe white template, the data visual articles it will produce, and data journalism in general should not replace traditional journalism as we know it, but should be seen as another much-needed layer of analysis in addition to breaking news. It is there to provide long-term analysis and perspective. \n\nThank you for reading this post and if you have any recommendations, statements, or questions, feel free to comment below or PM me.",

            "selftext": "So I was lying in bed last night and thinking about google cardboard and how else you can use it besides just viewing videos and I came up with this idea. First person shooters in real life. Similar to laser tag but much more accurate. Now when you think about this idea, you'd think that this is some futuristic idea that requires fast internet speed and high tech devices but I think I have at least a few ways to do this with very little internet bandwidth required.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSo the basic premise of this idea is to minimize internet usage, \u201clag\u201d, heat, and weight while maximizing mobility. The way to minimize internet usage and lag would be to make the entire system local. When you are in online matchmaking, other players send their location data to each other constantly. In real life we don\u2019t have that problem. All we need to do is keep track of the players health, when they fire (for ammo), and where they are *occasionally* (if we wanted to include some sort of UAV system). So as long as each player keeps track of themselves, they only need to send a signal when they die and respawn because everything else will be monitored individually. So the only obstacle now is the delay between the camera display (which I will explain later) and the delay between health and weapons (you can\u2019t fire your weapon when you are dead).\n \n\u00a0\n\nFirst I will be covering how \u201cbullets\u201d will interact with other players. This one is probably the most \u201cout there\u201d idea but I believe that it could be done at least within the near future. This idea revolves around full body laser detection suits. \n\n\u00a0\n\nThis suit would be a lightweight skin suit and fit around your entire body. It would be split up into different parts of the body because getting shot in different parts of your body applies different damages. So your arms would have their own sensors along with your legs and chest. Your head is where it may be a little tricky. I was thinking either a motorcycle helmet would look the best, although it wouldn\u2019t be the most mobile solution. But the other option would be some sort of ski mask that fits around google cardboard (think the CS:GO masks). This suit would be connected to a very small computer that will be located in your gun. There would be one cable that comes from your dominate hand/arm into the gun and would be modified like a cord reel so that you would still have range of motion.\n \n\u00a0\n\nThe gun is going to be a laser that is capable of shooting multiple lasers out at once. The reason it shoots out multiple is that the suit will pick up how many lasers would hit it at once and apply the \u201cdamage\u201d to the player. So sniper rifles would have 6 or so lasers shooting out at once in relatively the same direction. So when the player was hit, they don\u2019t need to communicate with anyone else to determine who shot them or what gun they were using because it will just add damage based on how many lasers have hit the suit. Other weapons such as assault rifles would fire periodically depending on how the weapon is balanced. Shotguns can have their lasers widened so that it would only make contact close up. The gun will be connected to your phone using short distance Bluetooth to avoid interfering with other players. There will also only be one gun for all types of guns. The gun will be capable of 2 different scopes that the players can use and switch between during the match. It would work similar to [this]( http://i.imgur.com/as9FY8W.png) where the dot in the middle would rotate to make the other scope appear on the top of the rifle. One could be a red dot like sight and the other could be a sniper scope. These could be removed and customized. The recoil on the gun could use vibration tools. I\u2019m sure there are other things that could be added but I am just trying to cover the basics.\n \n\u00a0\n\nSo now that the interaction between players is covered, we need to find a way for the players to interact with the game itself. What they see and what they hear are the 2 biggest concerns here. \n \n\u00a0\n\nSeeing would be handled by google cardboard (or possibly something better and lighter) and the back camera. The best way to implement this in my opinion would be to use something like [this]( http://photos2.appleinsidercdn.com/qx100-131031-2.jpg). Now if we have 2 cameras, it would be more accurate and nicer for the player. Cameras can be connected to phones by the charging cable, but this means that the phone cannot be charged during the game. They can also be attached using the audio output, but this means that we might not be able to implement fake sounds using headphones unless we use the gun, which increases the amount of data being transferred to the phone over Bluetooth. If we use the phones camera, the resolution and frames/second might be too low. But if those are too high because we used an external camera, there might be more delay. So there needs to be a balance between the two somehow. I believe the best solution would be to use something like [this]( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-fb4lEAXVBLs/VHRufckx1pI/AAAAAAAALI0/oU9Z6_jd_s4/s1600/smartphone-new-features-2.jpg) so that there is only one camera. Even though this sacrifices a few things, the output could be higher. BUT if your camera can record in a high resolution, then you can just use that one and have the added benefit of charging your phone while you play, and the charger could be corded to your pocket.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSound is the other concern. You can either have the guns making noise and then the other players hearing them naturally, but this will probably disturb other people (if you were in a park or something). The guns would also need to make loud enough sounds for other people to hear clearly without it sounding like those cheap toy guns. The other and possibly more usable way would be to use headphones to mix outside noises with fake noises. If the player were to fire in a certain location, a different player could be configured to hear how loud the sound is based on how far away the player who shot the bullet is. This would require players to send a signal to each other player using their location every time they pulled the trigger, but this would not take very much data. If we go with this route, players could also appear on a radar every time they fire because the signal is already being sent. So for this to work, it would just need to be placed on a map. Unfortunately, the location service isn\u2019t super precise. This means that the most accurate would be to use the gun noises, but the easiest would be to use headphones. Headphones will be used anyways to relay information about the game to the player anyways, unless they used their phone speaker. I feel the best way currently would be to use real sounds, simply because location services are not very precise right now. If location becomes more accurate and provides better real time location, then the other way might be the better solution.\n \n\u00a0\n\nSo that covers all of the important physical aspects of the game. Other things to worry about might be equipment protection, cooling, or recording. Recording could be easy, it would just require more processing, which could slow down the game. Cording is minimal as well. I can really see this being a thing but the only thing holding it back is probably the skin suit. Everything else is possible\u2026 It would be so cool to see this type of thing. You could play anywhere and the boundaries would be determined before the game. If this idea became a reality I would play it all of the time.",

Would you like to share this activity with your friends?\" Of course any ratings you post will also show up for your friends. Additionally, you'd have the ability to recommend your friends titles based upon what they've recently watched. Ex, in your stream you'd see what they'd watch and there'd be some kind of indicator that says \"Brian just finished watching season 3 episode 3 of Series the Series.

You decide! Just set the dial on your machine and off you go. I figure this would be set in a small English village so you could see everything back to the Middle Ages, even some of the Roman Empire, all the way back to neanderthals and beyond...\n\nPerhaps the object is to catch a criminal, like Carmen Sandiego. Or perhaps you've got to solve a mystery using procedurally-generated clues scattered throughout time. Maybe you'd just like to see what your great-great-grandparents were up to, or you're given mini-missions by various people taking advantage of your incredible machine.\n\nJust be careful: everything you do in the past affects the future \"in ways you can't imagine,\" as Abe Simpson would say. The open timeline is all plotted out, including thousands of generations of family histories and events, so changing something small can send bizarre ripples through history. And watch out that you don't meet yourself--that'll cause a rift in the space-time continuum, and everything will implode. Game over. Also don't do anything that would negate your own existence! Kill your grandfather? Game over.\n\nI figure this would have to be based on the Back to the Future-style time travel; that is, you can go back and change stuff, but it creates a new timeline every time you do (as opposed to closed-loop time travel as in Timecrimes or Predestination, which of course would be impossible here). The only thing is, if you were sent on a quest into the past and you changed something, when you went back to the future, the person who gave you the quest wouldn't have sent you on it...\n\nDetails, details. Make it happen, internet! I want to travel through time!\n\n[EDIT] Glad you like it! If you know any talented game makers out there tragically devoid of great game ideas, you know who to send them to...I'm handy with photoshop and conceptual stuff but coding is not my friend. I feel like if I could just get a proof of concept together, this thing'd be a shoe-in on Kickstarter.\n",

If people could rent it for a week or two and do tutorials to learn how to use it- that would expand the user base for the company, give users experience in the program (thus making them more hireable in those fields) and bridge the gap between entry level and \"entry level.\" You could even give the companies a cut of the rental fee. Why not?\n\nYou need to program a wrapper for the temporary license to work in but that's not too hard. Good encryption and all that.\n\nYou could even offer testing and certification that guarantees the users has a basic level of understanding of the program. \n\nI actually think this is a great idea but I am not a programmer and I have no marketing skills and I have no money so I'll never be able to make it happen.\n\nI even made a list of different types of industry specific softwares to pursue for this kind of thing:\n\nIntegrated Library Systems ; Dental software ; Patient registry software ; IT/troubleshooting software ; Accounting software ; POS software ; CMM programming ; CAD software ; Scheduling software ; CRM ; Debt Collection Software ; Electronic Medical Records software ; etc. ",

            "selftext": "Hey! So I'm working on an idea for an application. We have the beta almost finished, but we're still not sure if this is exactly the road we want go down. After our trip to LA for Techweek we got a few more directions to go. \n\nCurrently the app takes is for finding the best bars in your area. You filter by what type of bar you want to go to, based on price, bar type, and distance. You then get an arrow that points you to the direction of the bar but the trick is you don't know the name of the bar until you get there.\n\nNow the other idea that I pitched to the angel investors is the VIP idea. So basically the same thing as before but there is one bar per week per city that we will bring everyone too. Everyone brings that special item for the week, and with that you would get a sort of VIP service. Like have the waiter/waitress server you drinks before anyone else. It also promotes a tribe like behavior since everyone has something related to them.\n\nWhat do you all think about these two ideas? And which would you like better, if any? And thing you would like to see?\n\nAlso check out the website at http://www.scoutoutapp.com! The app itself is called Scout Out. All advice is appreciated!",

Several people are already inside at their own kiosks, and you walk over to an empty one and sit down. The large touch screen interface in front of you lights up and you begin navigating. In front of the interface is a well lit plantform about the size of the average car.\n\nYou activate the interface and begin to design your own car. You select the base model, a compact sedan, and the sedan appears in the platform infront of you via holographic projectors. It spins slowly in 360 degrees.\n\nYou customize all the features you want, devoid of any preset packages or mandatory minimums. As you add or preview features, the holographic image of the car in front of you responds accordingly, zooming in to the areas or interior allowing you to visually preview (where applicable) the part.\n\nAfter you have fully customized your vehicle, it shows the price. You save the vehicle in \"My Designs\". You head over to the financing area and get approved. You finalize your purchase, and it succeeds. \n\nAn electronic build order is then sent directly to the factory, and 2-4 weeks later you receive and drive your car away. Transport fees can be avoided if you pick it up directly from the factory.\n\nI am confident this would revolutionize the car buying experience. You could offer cheaper vehicles just as good as the others (if designed properly) and allow the consumer full control over the customization (I know there is a degree of freedom already out there in that department).

            "selftext": " I have been touched personally by the Refugee Crisis. I know you care about the issue as well.  I am a student of the University of Akron. Our governor has recently joined Ohio in the ranks of 31 other states currently rejecting the 10,000 Syrian Refugees from being re-settled in their states.\n  I am preparing a proposal as part of my work at the University detailing a Bipartisan plan to help the Syrian Refugees. I have a plan, detailed in my proposal to settle the refugees attempting to enter the US in Indonesia paid for by US federal funds. The estimated cost of resettling the refugees in the United states is $64,370,000 according to a recent (2015) C.I.S study (Center for Immigration Studies). The cost of my plan would cost $28,155,600 that is 43.7% cheaper for the tax payer than resettlement inside the United States. This makes my plan more 56.3% more cost effective than the current plan. (Cost breakdown and analysis provided in my proposal)\n      Moreover, a recent Bloomberg poll reports 53% of Americans are opposed to allowing the refugees settlement in the United States. Having spoken with many of my fellow democrats and even republicans on this issue the majority of people think we ought to help them for moral reasons but worry for the security of their families. I personally believe that we have a responsibility as not just Americans but as human beings to help them. This is why I set out to come up with a solution that all parties involved, both the American left and Right and the Syrian Refugees would find satisfactory. Helping these people does not have to be a partisan issue. \n  It is important to note the difference between refugees and immigrants. Immigrants come to a new country because they identify with with countries culture and ideals. In our case they come seeking the 'American Dream'. Refugees However do not have a choice, the people who fled the war were for the most part happy with their culture and ideals prior to the onset of hostilities. The Refugees do not want to adapt to join our culture they simply feel it is the best way to achieve the security they need as we all do as humans. I believe they would be much more content if it were possible to settle them in a country with a culture more like their own.  \n    My plan is basically this, The United States fund the resettlement of the 10,000 Syrian refugees in Indonesia. Indonesia is a great country and is the largest majority Muslim country in the world (82%). They are accepting of all religions but have a much more Islamic in nature culture than we do in the United States.  It is my opinion that the refugees will have a much easier time adjusting to their new home if it is as close to their prewar homeland as possible. As previously mention the cost of doing this would be 43.7% of the cost of settling them in the United States. It is for this reason that I believe we could achieve  massive bipartisan victory with a plan based on my proposal. The refugees get the help they need and a home they will like the most. We do not have to settle them here, and it is less than half the cost of doing it here.\n     The UNHCR currently does not have the funding to accommodate the massive number of refugees and my plan solves that issue for 10,000 of them. People die every day that goes by waiting for re-settlement that will not come until proper funding is put towards the issue.\n I know you are an incredibly busy person but I also know you care about this issue. Obviously this solution is meant to help the refugees as fast as possible and solutions to the root problem still need to be reached but this is something we can do today. The refugee's cannot wait anymore.\n  I need your help to make a real positive change in the world. If you are interested in learning more about this plan please contact me. Check out the facebook page for my proposal https://www.facebook.com/Refugeeplan for even more information.\nBest Regards,\nLucas Geer\nThe University of Akron\n",

It's called Magma, and with this app, you \"check-in\" to your location, see everyone else who is also checked into your location and everyone nearby (within a radius that you can set). You can then \"Break The Ice\" with them in the app.\n\nYou can find the app here: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/magma-meet-people-around-you/id1044983810?mt=8\n\nHere's our launch video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW6mVLykE8g\n\n\nLet me know what you think!

Named MedPort. So that you do not have to sting yourself with a needle everytime you have to take your medication. \n\nThe device itselfis implanted into the body. Acting as an artificial skin with an airlock. It's selfcleaning and gets everything it needs from the medical cartridges which carry the medicine. The port itself is purely mechanical thus i also sketched a sensor attachement which would gain access to the body through the MedPort.\n\nThe sketches can be viewed here http://imgur.com/gallery/tNTyk/\nPicture 1: The Port itself\nPicture 2: The Cartridge carrying the medicine and maintenenace supplies for the port.\nPicture 3: A Sensor which measures some body fluid",

The idea is as above, so kinda like those pin things you can put your hand in and it makes the shape of your hand, except it uses tiny pins to fit into screw heads. \n\nMy main concern about it is whether there exist a material strong enough for that purpose. Would be great to hear people's thoughts on it!",

Create a detective style of book series with an intelligent character as the lead like Sherlock Holmes/Hercule Poirot/Harry Hole. Make him/her run into life or death situation just for him to narrowly escape death. By book no. 7, in the middle of the book, make the character face a similar life or death situation. While the readers expect him to escape as usual, let him die abruptly. Let another character finish the case and mourn his death. Make this the final book in the series.

Tilting and maneuvering are necessary to get polish out if the polish is only even half gone. This is difficult when painting your nails. \n\n- There's always too much polish on the wand once it is removed from the container. This creates a need to 'wipe' the wand on the top of the container thus spreading the polish on the top. When that polish dries, it often makes the container much more difficult to open. \n \nSolution: \n\n- Create some sort of new nail polish container where the wand can reach ALL of the polish in the container. What comes to mind is the latest cleaning containers that have the spout running down the side so you can get the last drop [example](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9YY8i3va1Bo/UWhuFGv_GOI/AAAAAAAAXoU/yaxGHntS0tI/s1600/images.jpeg)\n\n- Create some sort of mechanism just inside the cap that brushes off the polish to have just the right amount for application on the wand. \n\n\nI don't normally think of innovations to products, but the nail industry is starting to see a shift with Jamberry Nail Wraps and such, so it might be time for some container innovation to make lives easier :) ",

While sitting in my car, frustrated i wasted a good 5-10 min trying to find a parking spot not a mile away from school, I thought to myself why don't we have more efficient parking lots.  The Idea i have is to build parking lots that have sensors to detect when a parking spot is vacant or not. whether these sensors are pressure plates under each spot, or cameras that sense when a spot is full or not. Next these sensors would relay back to a screen at either side of the row that would show whether it had open spots. it wouldn't necessarily show which spot is open but rather just number of spots open. \n\nThe reasoning is because it would we live in a world that prides it self on being efficient and i feel like our parking lots are lacking, i hear people all the time talk about wasting time trying to find a parking spot, or just getting over all frustrated. I realize the biggest obstacle is cost. ",

You can also pop the unit into a washer or dryer and it will keep it all together but separate from everything else in the dryer. I think it will be helpful to people who have a uniform for work, a sport uniform, or maybe someone who just goes to the gym on the reg. What are your thoughts??",
